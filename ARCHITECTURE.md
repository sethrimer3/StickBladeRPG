# DustWeaver — Architecture

## Render Pipeline

Two canvases are layered in the DOM:

1. **WebGL canvas** (inserted first / lower z-order) — `WebGLParticleRenderer`
   renders the dark background + all particle point sprites in a single draw
   call.  On devices where WebGL is unavailable the canvas is not inserted.
2. **2D canvas** (`#game-canvas`, on top) — renders cluster indicators, health
   bars, HUD overlay, and UI text.  When WebGL is active the 2D canvas is fully
   cleared each frame (`clearRect`) so transparent areas expose the WebGL layer.
   When WebGL is unavailable the 2D canvas fills the background and renders
   particles via `renderParticles` (Canvas 2D arc fallback).

The render call order each frame:
1. `webglRenderer.render(snapshot, offsetX, offsetY, zoom)` — background + particles (WebGL) **or**
   `ctx.fillRect` + `renderParticles` (Canvas 2D fallback)
2. `renderWalls(ctx, snapshot, offsetX, offsetY, zoom)` — auto-tiling block sprites (2D)
3. `renderClusters(ctx, snapshot, offsetX, offsetY, zoom)` — entity boxes and health bars (2D)
4. `renderGrapple(ctx, snapshot, offsetX, offsetY, zoom)` — grapple rope/anchor (2D)
5. `drawTunnelDarkness(ctx, room, offsetX, offsetY, zoom)` — transition tunnel fade-to-black (2D)
6. `environmentalDust.render(ctx, offsetX, offsetY, zoom)` — environmental dust layer (2D)
7. `renderHudOverlay(ctx, hud)` — FPS / frame-time / particle-count (2D)
8. Room name banner, control hints, touch joystick (2D)

Camera (`render/camera.ts`) follows the player cluster position with a smooth
lerp, clamped to room bounds so the viewport never shows outside the room.

## Metroidvania Room System

Room definitions live in `levels/roomDef.ts` (types) and `levels/rooms.ts` (data).
Each room specifies walls, enemies, and transitions in block-unit coordinates.
The game screen loads one room at a time; transitions swap the entire sim state.
Campaign room JSON loading uses the room manifest as an ordering hint and also
discovers `ASSETS/CAMPAIGNS/*/ROOMS/*.json` at build time, so newly added room
files appear in the editor without manually editing `manifest.json`.

```
World 2 ←—[tunnel]—— LOBBY ——[tunnel]—→ World 1
```

## Layer Separation

```
Input → Commands → Game Loop → Sim (tick) → Snapshot → Renderer
```

- `input/`: Maps browser events to `GameCommand` objects.
- `sim/`: Pure deterministic physics. No DOM. No random. No wall-clock.
- `render/`: Reads `WorldSnapshot`. Never mutates sim state.
- `ui/`: HTML overlays for menus.

## Tick Loop

1. Collect input commands.
2. Apply commands to WorldState (move player cluster).
3. Run `tick(world)` one or more times (accumulator).
4. Create `WorldSnapshot`.
5. Render snapshot.

## Collision Pipeline (`sim/clusters/movementCollision.ts`)

Cluster wall collision uses axis-separated sweeps with sub-step safety to prevent
tunneling through thin walls at high speed.

**Primary path** (`resolveClusterSolidWallCollision`):
  1. X pass: integrate X velocity, resolve all X overlaps (push out, zero velX on contact).
  2. Y pass: integrate Y velocity, resolve all Y overlaps (push out, zero velY on contact,
     set `isGroundedFlag` on top-face landing).
  Sub-steps fire when `|velocity × dt| > halfExtent` to guarantee no thin-wall tunneling.

**Ramp path** (`resolveRampSurfaces`): called after the wall sweep; handles diagonal
  surfaces by computing per-axis surface height at the cluster center X.

**Collision-safe displacement helper** (`moveClusterByDelta`):
  For forced/special movement (e.g. grapple constraint snap) that knows a desired
  displacement but not a velocity.  Converts delta → velocity, runs the full sweep
  from the current position, restores original velocity, returns `ClusterMoveResult`.
  Preferred over direct position assignment + `resolveAABBPenetration` fallback for
  any path that can displace the cluster by more than a fraction of a world unit.

**Last-resort fallback** (`resolveAABBPenetration` in `sim/physics/collision.ts`):
  Minimum-penetration push-out.  Used only for micro-corrections after the grapple
  stuck-phase locks position each tick.  Must not be used as the primary resolver.

**Collision iteration order**: walls are always iterated in `world.wallCount` order
(the order they were merged and stored in `loadRoomWalls`).  This order is fixed at
room load time and is deterministic.  Do not sort or reorder walls at runtime.

## Particle Integration Pipeline

Each tick:
1. Clear forces.
2. Apply per-element forces: hash-noise perturbation, curl-noise turbulence,
   isotropic diffusion, upward/buoyancy bias (`elementForces.ts`).
3. Apply binding forces: element-aware anchor spring + orbital tangential
   force driving circular orbit around the owner cluster (`binding.ts`).
4. Apply inter-particle forces: different-owner repulsion + contact
   destruction; same-owner boid forces (cohesion, separation, alignment)
   weighted by element profiles (`forces.ts`).
5. Euler integration with per-element drag (`integration.ts`).
6. Lifetime update: age particles; respawn expired particles at their owner
   with new random anchor offsets (`lifetime.ts`).
7. Increment tick counter.

## Elemental Particle System

`sim/particles/elementProfiles.ts` defines `ElementProfile` — a struct of
~18 tunable coefficients (mass, drag, orbitalStrength, noiseAmplitude,
instability, cohesion, lifetime, …) — and one named preset per `ParticleKind`.

Force pipeline layers (all accumulated before integration):
- **Element forces** (`elementForces.ts`): hash-noise perturbation (rate
  controlled by `instability`), curl-noise turbulence, diffusion, upward bias.
- **Binding forces** (`binding.ts`): spring toward per-particle anchor point
  (owner pos + polar offset) scaled by `attractionStrength`; tangential
  orbital force scaled by `orbitalStrength`.
- **Inter-particle forces** (`forces.ts`): same-owner boid (cohesion,
  separation, alignment); different-owner repulsion + contact destruction.

**Adding a new element:**
1. Add a `ParticleKind` enum value in `sim/particles/kinds.ts`.
2. Add an `ElementProfile` constant and push it into `ELEMENT_PROFILES`
   at the matching index in `sim/particles/elementProfiles.ts`.
3. Add a matching colour entry in `render/particles/styles.ts` (Canvas 2D)
   and a `kindColor()` branch in the fragment shader in
   `render/particles/shaders.ts` (WebGL).



- `WorldSnapshot` is a shallow readonly view of the current sim state.
- Created each frame before rendering.
- Renderer only reads from snapshot — never from `WorldState` directly.

## Input Pipeline

- `KeyboardEvent` → `InputState` (mutable booleans).
- `collectCommands(inputState)` → `GameCommand[]` per frame.
- Commands applied before sim tick.
- F key produces `CommandKind.Interact` for skill tomb interaction.

## Death Screen

When the player cluster dies (`isAliveFlag === 0`):
1. Sim ticks and room transitions are skipped (freeze effect).
2. `showDeathScreen` renders a 50% dark overlay + blurred goldEmbers animation
   at 50% opacity + "Dusts..." text + navigation buttons.
3. "Return to Last Save" reloads the saved room/spawn from `PlayerProgress`.
4. "Return to Main Menu" exits gameplay.

## Skill Tomb System

Skill tombs are interactable save points placed in rooms.
- `SkillTombRenderer` manages the sprite and golden dust particle effects.
- When the player is within `SKILL_TOMB_INTERACT_RADIUS_WORLD` (90 units):
  - Golden dust swirls around the tomb.
  - "Press F to interact" prompt appears.
- When the player leaves proximity, dust turns dull gold and falls to ground.
- Interaction opens `showSkillTombMenu` with Loadout and World Map tabs.
- Progress is auto-saved on interaction and on menu close.

## Skill Tomb Menu

Two-tab menu (`ui/skillTombMenu.ts`):
1. **Loadout** — particle kind selection (same as old loadout screen).
2. **World Map** — canvas-based room map with zoom (mouse wheel) and pan (drag).
   Shows explored rooms with blocks, doorways (blue), and skill tombs (gold).
- ESC closes the menu without opening the pause menu (captured with `{ capture: true }`).
- X button in top-right corner also closes.

## World Editor (BUILD 35)

The world editor is an in-game level editing tool accessible via the debug UI.

### Module Layout (`src/editor/`)
- **editorState.ts** — Core state: mode, tool, palette, selection, mutable `EditorRoomData`.
- **editorController.ts** — Orchestrator: lifecycle, input processing, tool dispatch, UI wiring.
- **editorCamera.ts** — Free WASD camera panning independent of the player.
- **editorInput.ts** — Keyboard/mouse/wheel input isolated from gameplay input.
- **editorTools.ts** — Select, Place, Delete tool logic with grid-snapping and hit testing.
- **editorUI.ts** — DOM-based toolbar, palette panel, inspector panel, export button.
- **editorRenderer.ts** — Canvas overlays: grid, placement preview, selection highlights, transition zones.
- **editorWorldMap.ts** — Room list overlay (M key) for jumping between rooms.
- **transitionLinker.ts** — Cross-room transition linking workflow.
- **editorExport.ts** — Browser download of room JSON.
- **roomJson.ts** — `RoomJsonDef` schema, validation, conversion between JSON ↔ `EditorRoomData` ↔ `RoomDef`.

### Block Theme Placement
- The block palette keeps a placement-only `selectedBlockTheme` in `EditorState`; changing it does not mutate `EditorRoomData.blockTheme` and therefore does not restyle existing walls.
- Newly placed walls always receive their own `blockTheme`, allowing several block themes to coexist in one room.
- The editor shows the last three used themes inline and opens the full theme palette from the adjacent palette button.
- Theme options and chip thumbnails come from `ASSETS/SPRITES/BLOCKS/<theme>/` folder discovery, including the original Blackstone, Brownstone, and Dirt folders.

### Integration with Game Screen
- `EditorController` is created once in `startGameScreen()`.
- A "World Editor" button appears when debug mode is on.
- When editor is active, the frame function skips gameplay (sim, input, transitions)
  and delegates to the editor's update/render cycle.
- The editor calls `loadRoom()` to apply changes to the runtime world when jumping rooms.


## Progression System (BUILD 74)

### Module Layout
```
src/progression/
  playerProgress.ts      — PlayerProgress type, default factory, slot helpers
  saveSlots.ts           — localStorage persistence (3 slots, auto-migration)
  passiveTechniques.ts   — Passive technique definitions (e.g., Cycle)
  dustCapacity.ts        — Container-based capacity model
  unlocks.ts             — Progression unlock functions
```

### Clean Category Separation
- **Passive techniques** (e.g., Cycle) — always active once unlocked, NOT bindable to LMB/RMB
- **Dust types** (e.g., Golden Dust, Fire Dust) — unlocked independently
- **Active weaves** (e.g., Spire, Aegis) — bound to LMB/RMB via WeaveBinding
- **Dust containers** — each grants 4 capacity; different dust types cost different amounts

### Capacity Model
- Each dust container grants `CAPACITY_PER_CONTAINER = 4` capacity
- Total capacity = `dustContainerCount × 4`
- Golden Dust (Physical) costs 1 capacity per particle → 8 particles with 2 containers
- Fire Dust costs 2 capacity per particle → 4 particles with 2 containers

### Early Game Progression Flow
1. New profile starts empty (0 containers, 0 dust, no weaves, no techniques)
2. Loadout screen is NOT shown for new profiles
3. Early unlock: Cycle passive technique (dust orbits the player)
4. Next unlock: Golden Dust + 2 dust containers (auto-configured, no menu needed)
5. After auto-assignment, loadout changes only happen at save tombs

### Dust Recharge Rule
- Player-owned dust only recharges (respawn delay countdown) while the player is grounded
- Enemy dust recharges normally regardless of grounded state
- Implemented in `sim/particles/lifetime.ts`

### HUD Layout (top-left)
1. Health bar (always visible, screen-anchored)
2. Dust container display (below health bar)

### Module Layout
```
src/sim/weaves/
  dustDefinition.ts    — Dust type registry (id, name, slot cost, color)
  weaveDefinition.ts   — Weave registry (id, name, pattern data, capacity)
  playerLoadout.ts     — PlayerWeaveLoadout type, binding validation
  weaveCombat.ts       — Weave force application in tick pipeline
```

### Tick Pipeline Integration
The Weave combat system is injected at step 4.55, after the legacy combat forces:
```
4.5  applyCombatForces()          — legacy enemy attack/block
4.55 applyPlayerWeaveCombat()     — Weave-based player combat
```

### Data Flow
1. Player selects Weaves and binds dust in loadout UI (ui/weaveLoadout.ts or ui/skillTombMenu.ts)
2. Loadout is stored in PlayerProgress.weaveLoadout
3. At room load, spawnWeaveLoadoutParticles assigns weaveSlotId to each particle
4. WorldState stores equipped weave IDs and activation flags
5. Input handler generates WeaveActivate/WeaveHold/WeaveEnd commands
6. gameScreen converts screen aim to world direction and sets world state flags
7. weaveCombat.ts reads flags each tick and applies pattern forces to bound particles

### Snapshot Boundary
- ParticleSnapshot does not include weaveSlotId (not needed for rendering)
- WorldSnapshot includes isPlayerWeaveActiveFlag for sprite animation hints

## Radiant Tether Boss (BUILD 42)

### Tick Pipeline Addition
- Step 0.5d: `applyRadiantTetherAI(world)` — boss state machine and chain winching.
- Boss clusters are skipped by standard enemy AI (`enemyAi.ts`) and ground movement.
- Boss movement is handled entirely by the chain tension system.

### Module Structure
- `sim/clusters/radiantTetherConfig.ts` — all tunable constants.
- `sim/clusters/radiantTetherAi.ts` — state machine (inactive→telegraph→lock→fire→move→reset→dead).
- `sim/clusters/radiantTetherChains.ts` — chain lifecycle, raycasting, snap detection, sag calculation, player collision.
- `render/clusters/radiantTetherRenderer.ts` — boss body, telegraph lasers, active chains, broken chains, debug overlay.

### Chain State Management
- Chain state (`RadiantTetherChainState`) is module-level in `radiantTetherAi.ts` (one boss per room).
- Reset when `loadRoom()` is called via `resetRadiantTetherState()`.
- Renderer accesses chain state via `getRadiantTetherChainState()`.

### Snapshot Boundary
- `ClusterSnapshot` includes: `isRadiantTetherFlag`, `radiantTetherState`, `radiantTetherStateTicks`, `radiantTetherBaseAngleRad`, `radiantTetherChainCount`.
- Chain visual data (anchor positions, broken chain positions) is read directly from the module-level chain state by the renderer, not copied into the snapshot.

## Two-Layer Procedural Cloak (BUILD 111)

The player cloak is a single connected garment rendered as two visual layers: a darker **back cloak** behind the body and a lighter **front cloak** in front of the body. Both layers are driven by one shared simulation (point chain + shape state).

### Render Order
1. Back cloak (`renderBack`) — behind player body
2. Player body sprite (outline mask + sprite)
3. Front cloak (`renderFront`) — in front of player body

### Module Structure
- `render/clusters/cloakConstants.ts` — all tunable constants (anchor, shape, spread, openness, colors, thresholds).
- `render/clusters/playerCloak.ts` — `PlayerCloak` class: chain simulation, shared shape state (spread, openness, fast-fall, timers), polygon builders for back/front, debug overlay.

### Shape State Model
The shared cloak state computes:
- `spreadAmount` (0–1): how wide the cloak opens, varies by movement state.
- `opennessAmount` (0–1): how far front/back layers separate.
- `isFastFallActiveFlag`: triggers dramatic widening with sharp outer corners.
- `turnTimerSec` / `landingTimerSec`: drive overshoot and compression effects.

Both cloak polygons derive from the same chain points and shape state, with the front cloak shorter, narrower, and offset toward the player's facing direction.

## Dust Combat Pipeline (BUILD 113)

### Weave Combat Flow
Each tick, `applyPlayerWeaveCombat()` in `sim/weaves/weaveCombat.ts` runs two passes:

1. **Storm Attraction** (always active):
   - Scans all alive, unowned, Physical particles within 80 world units of the player
   - Applies radial attraction force (strength 120, distance falloff)
   - Claims particles within 12 world units (resets owner, lifetime, behavior to orbit)

2. **Shield Crescent** (when mouse button held):
   - Collects all player-owned alive particles (excluding grapple chain)
   - Computes arc size: `halfArc = 0.15 + min(1, count/30) × (π/2 - 0.15)`
   - Distributes particles evenly across the arc centered on aim direction
   - Applies spring force (600) toward target positions
   - Sets particles to `behaviorMode = 2` (block) while active
   - On mouse release, resets all block-mode particles to orbit (`behaviorMode = 0`)

### Dust Pile Spawning
- Room definitions include optional `dustPiles: RoomDustPileDef[]`
- At room load, `gameRoom.ts` loads pile positions into WorldState arrays
- `gameScreen.ts` calls `spawnDustPileParticles()` for each pile
- Spawned particles are unowned (entityId = -1), transient, Physical kind with 99999-tick lifetime
- Environmental dust layer skips procedural generation in lobby rooms (worldNumber 0)

### Dust Rendering
- Particles render as 3×3 virtual pixel squares (diameter 3 world units)
- WebGL: shape index 2 (Square) via `KIND_SHAPE[0]` and GLSL `kindShape()` default return
- Canvas 2D fallback: `fillRect` in `drawParticleShape()` for `ParticleShape.Square`
- Additive glow: `drawParticleGlow()` in `gameRender.ts` adds bloom circles for Physical/Gold particles
