/**
 * roomAssetPreloader.ts — Proactive sprite preloading for block themes.
 *
 * Calling preloadRoomThemeSprites() immediately after a room is entered (or
 * at campaign start) fires loadImg() for every sprite URL associated with that
 * room's block themes.  Because loadImg() is already a singleton cache, there
 * is no cost to calling it on a URL that was already requested — it simply
 * returns the cached element.
 *
 * preloadAdjacentRoomAssets() extends this to all rooms directly connected to
 * `room` through door transitions.  It is called after every loadRoom() so
 * that the next room's sprites are in flight while the player is still walking
 * through the current room.
 *
 * areRoomSpritesReady() checks whether all folder-based sprites for a room
 * have finished loading.  It is used by the loading overlay in gameScreen.ts
 * to decide when it is safe to show the game world.
 *
 * Note: only folder-based themes (e.g. 'grayStone', 'blackRock') are tracked
 * here.  Legacy world-number sprites (world 0–9 block/edge/corner/end sets)
 * begin loading at module-init time in blockSpriteSets.ts and are typically
 * ready within a few hundred milliseconds — they do not need explicit
 * preloading via this module.
