/**
 * Weave Definition Layer.
 *
 * A Weave is the active combat technique that controls how bound dust moves
 * when activated. The Weave defines the deployment pattern (motion shape),
 * timing, and activation role (primary / secondary / either).
 *
 * Weave definitions are data + behavior strategy:
 *   - Data: id, display name, description, slot capacity, timing, role support
 *   - Behavior: activation pattern that moves bound dust particles each tick
 *
 * The Weave is the main source of active combat readability. Dust type governs
 * passive motion and elemental identity; Weave governs the active form.
