/**
 * Step 0.25 — Enforces the rope constraint and applies swing physics.
 *
 * Called after applyClusterMovement (which applies gravity and floor collision)
 * so the constraint acts on the fully-updated cluster position and velocity.
 *
 * Controls:
 *   • Jump (W/Space/Up) → release grapple + upward velocity impulse.
 *   • Down (S/ArrowDown) held → retract (shorten) the rope.
 *     Shortening conserves angular momentum so the player swings faster.
 *     RMB while attached → activate zip: player rockets toward the anchor,
 *     momentum stops on arrival, then a 0.15 s zip-jump window opens.
 *     Jump in window = high-velocity zip-jump biased by held input direction.
 *     Miss window = grapple releases quietly, no automatic impulse.
 *
 * Pipeline per tick:
 *   1. Consume playerJumpTriggeredFlag and playerDownTriggeredFlag.
 *   2. Delegate zip activation + state machine to tickGrappleZip.
 *   3. If zip active → skip normal swing.
 *   4. Jump pressed (normal swing) → release with upward impulse.
 *   5. While down held (retraction):
 *      a. Decompose velocity into radial + tangential components.
 *      b. Shorten the rope.
 *      c. Scale tangential velocity by (oldLength / newLength) to conserve
 *         angular momentum.
 *      d. Recompose velocity from radial + boosted tangential.
 *   6. Enforce rope length: if player distance > ropeLength, snap position
 *      onto the rope circle and remove the outward radial velocity component.
 *   7. Post-constraint wall collision check to prevent ground clipping.
 *   8. Preserve tangential velocity indefinitely unless another gameplay
 *      force, collision, or rope retraction changes it.
