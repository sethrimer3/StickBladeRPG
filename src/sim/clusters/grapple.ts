/**
 * Grappling hook mechanics — physically convincing pendulum swing.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * DEVELOPER NOTES — PHYSICS MODEL
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * 1. Momentum Preservation
 *    When the grapple attaches, the player's existing velocity is left entirely
 *    untouched.  The rope constraint only acts when the player tries to move
 *    *beyond* the rope length — at that point it removes the outward radial
 *    component of velocity (the part pulling away from the anchor) while
 *    preserving the tangential component (the swing).  This means a fast-moving
 *    player naturally carries their speed into a wide arc.
 *
 * 2. Rope Shortening → Speed Increase (Conservation of Angular Momentum)
 *    Angular momentum L = m × v_tangential × radius.  When the rope shortens
 *    from L_old to L_new, the tangential velocity is scaled by (L_old / L_new)
 *    so that L is conserved.  This is why figure skaters spin faster when they
 *    pull their arms in — same physics.  The result feels like the player is
 *    winding up for a powerful launch.
 *
 * 3. Swing Damping
 *    A very subtle damping factor is applied to the tangential velocity each
 *    tick while grappling.  This models air resistance / rope friction and
 *    slowly bleeds energy so the player cannot swing forever without input.
 *    The damping only affects the tangential component — gravity's natural
 *    acceleration is not penalised.  At the default coefficient (0.12 per
 *    second) the player barely notices energy loss within a single swing but
 *    will feel it after 3–4 full oscillations.
 *
 * 4. Jump Off Grapple
 *    While the grapple is active, pressing jump immediately releases the
 *    grapple and adds an upward velocity impulse (equal to the normal jump
 *    speed).  This lets the player "jump off" the rope at any point in their
 *    swing, combining their swing momentum with the upward boost.
 *
 * 5. Rope Retraction (Hold Down/S)
 *    While the grapple is active, holding down/S retracts the rope.  As the
 *    rope shortens, angular momentum is conserved (v_tang × radius = const),
 *    so the player swings faster.  If the accumulated retraction exceeds
 *    GRAPPLE_MAX_PULL_IN_WORLD the rope snaps.
 *
 * 6. Single Grapple Charge
 *    The player can only grapple once until they touch the ground or grapple
 *    onto a top surface (which instantly refreshes the charge).  This prevents
 *    infinite air grappling while still allowing ledge-to-ledge chaining.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The grapple attaches an inextensible rope from the player cluster to a fixed
 * world-space anchor point. Each tick two operations are performed:
 *
 *   applyGrappleClusterConstraint  (step 0.25, after cluster movement)
 *     • If jump pressed: releases grapple with upward velocity impulse.
 *     • While down/S held: retracts the rope, conserving angular momentum.
 *     • Enforces the rope length: snaps the player back onto the rope circle
 *       and removes the outward radial velocity component.
 *     • Runs a post-constraint wall collision check to prevent ground clipping.
 *     • Applies subtle tangential damping.
 *
 *   updateGrappleChainParticles    (step 6.75, after particle integration)
 *     • Positions GRAPPLE_SEGMENT_COUNT Gold particles evenly along the rope
 *       between the player cluster and the anchor.
 *     • Zeroes their velocity so integration-accumulated drift is discarded.
 *
 * Chain particles are pre-allocated in the particle buffer by the game screen
 * at startup (grappleParticleStartIndex) and kept alive/dead according to the
 * grapple active state.

/**
 * Releases the grapple and deactivates the chain particles.
 * The player retains their current velocity (built-up swing momentum).
/**
 * Step 0.25 — Enforces the rope constraint and applies swing physics.
 *
 * Called after applyClusterMovement (which applies gravity and floor collision)
 * so the constraint acts on the fully-updated cluster position and velocity.
 *
 * Controls:
 *   • Jump (W/Space/Up) → release grapple + upward velocity impulse.
 *   • Down (S/ArrowDown) held → retract (shorten) the rope.
 *     Shortening conserves angular momentum so the player swings faster.
 *   • Down double-tap → activate zip: player rockets toward the anchor,
 *     momentum stops on arrival, then a 0.25 s zip-jump window opens.
 *     Jump in window = high-velocity zip-jump in surface normal direction.
 *     Miss window = gentle hop off the surface.
 *     Double-tap + hold after arrival = stay stuck until jump or release.
 *
 * Pipeline per tick:
 *   1. Consume playerJumpTriggeredFlag and playerDownTriggeredFlag.
 *   2. Delegate zip detection + state machine to tickGrappleZip.
 *   3. If zip active → skip normal swing.
 *   4. Jump pressed (normal swing) → release with upward impulse.
 *   5. While down held (retraction):
 *      a. Decompose velocity into radial + tangential components.
 *      b. Shorten the rope.
 *      c. Scale tangential velocity by (oldLength / newLength) to conserve
 *         angular momentum.
 *      d. Recompose velocity from radial + boosted tangential.
 *   6. Enforce rope length: if player distance > ropeLength, snap position
 *      onto the rope circle and remove the outward radial velocity component.
 *   7. Post-constraint wall collision check to prevent ground clipping.
 *   8. Apply subtle tangential damping (air resistance / friction).
