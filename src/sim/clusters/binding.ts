/**
 * Owner-anchor binding forces.
 *
 * Each particle has a unique anchor point relative to its owner cluster:
 *   anchorTarget = ownerPos + (cos(anchorAngleRad), sin(anchorAngleRad)) * anchorRadiusWorld
 *
 * Two forces are applied:
 *   1. Spring (attraction) toward the anchor target, scaled by attractionStrength.
 *   2. Orbital (tangential) force perpendicular to the owner→particle vector,
 *      scaled by orbitalStrength.  This drives circular orbiting without needing
 *      to rotate the anchor angle each tick.
 *
 * Influence radius: binding forces are only applied when a particle is within
 * INFLUENCE_RADIUS_WORLD of its owner.  Particles that drift outside this radius
 * (e.g. after being knocked back) move freely until they re-enter the ring.
 *
 * Force magnitudes come from the particle's ElementProfile so each element
 * feels differently "attached" to its owner.
 *
 * Player-state behaviors (player orbit particles only):
 *
 *  Attacking — some player particles are in attack mode (behaviorMode 1); the
 *    remaining orbit particles swirl faster (boosted orbitalStrength) to convey
 *    a charging/excited look while the attack is in flight.
 *
 *  Blocking — handled entirely by combat.ts (particles set to mode 2 and
 *    positioned into shield formations); no changes here.
 *
 *  Standing still — player is grounded and nearly stationary: orbital force is
 *    greatly reduced so particles slow to a hovering halo.  The spring radius
 *    breathes gently in/out with a per-particle phase offset, giving a calm
 *    "idle pulse" feel.
 *
 *  Jumping — player is airborne: the computed spring target is displaced
 *    backward (opposite to player velocity) by an offset that grows with speed
 *    up to TRAIL_OFFSET_MAX_WORLD.  This pulls particles into a comet-tail
 *    stream behind the player.  Orbital force is reduced so particles trail
 *    rather than orbit.
