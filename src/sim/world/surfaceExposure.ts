/**
 * surfaceExposure.ts — authoritative tile-level open-air surface map.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for "which sides of a solid
 * tile are exposed to open air". It intentionally knows nothing about
 * grouped/merged block rectangles (see blockWallLayoutCache.ts /
 * gameRoomWalls.ts) — those are load-time or render-time optimizations and
 * must never be used to define surface truth. Anything that needs to know
 * "is this tile side a valid open-air surface" (grapple targeting, edge
 * shading, etc.) should eventually be able to query this module instead of
 * re-deriving exposure from its own local neighbour checks.
 *
 * Two layers are provided on purpose:
 *   - Base geometric exposure (this module): solid tile + in-bounds air
 *     neighbour, nothing else. No darkness/visibility/gameplay state.
 *   - Active/visible eligibility: a thin filter on top (see
 *     `filterVisibleSurfaceSegments`) that callers can use to add
 *     darkness/fog/editor-visibility rules without touching the base map.
 *
 * TODO(surface-exposure): grapple targeting (src/sim/clusters/grappleShared.ts
 * `raycastWalls`) currently derives valid surfaces purely from merged wall
 * rectangles via AABB raycasts. Once this module is proven out, grapple hit
 * results should be cross-checked against `getSurfaceMaskAtTile` (or a
 * `queryNearestSurfaceSegment` lookup) so grapples can't anchor to a side
 * that is actually buried inside a grouped block.
 *
 * TODO(surface-exposure): the edge-shading open-air mask computed inline in
 * `src/render/walls/wallTilePassRenderers.ts` (`render1x1Pass` /
 * `render2x2Pass`) duplicates a subset of this module's logic using the
 * render-time `CachedWallLayout.occupied` set, which has no room-bounds
 * awareness (out-of-bounds neighbours are treated as open air there). That
 * renderer is a hot per-frame path, so it should not be rewritten to call
 * into this module without profiling — but new debug/inspection tooling
 * should prefer this module so discrepancies are easy to spot.
