  //
  //   1. `_isZoneReadyNow` queued entry-viewport tasks BEFORE base readiness,
  //      i.e. before any resident build had populated RoomRuntimeCache, so the
  //      producer skipped every transition and the one-shot `tasksQueued` latch
  //      prevented any retry — zero tasks for 48 requirements.
  //   2. Runtime-cache entries written by the resident builder leave
  //      blockerKeys/darkBlockerKeys/wallDecorations null, and nothing computes
  //      them while the zone overlay holds the frame — so `isEntryFullyPrepared`
  //      (required by the readiness barrier) could never become true.
  //   3. Pre-warmed chunks for zone rooms were not protected from the
  //      memory-budget eviction pass, so coverage was destroyed as fast as it
  //      was built and the barrier oscillated forever.
  //
  // These use the real ZoneResidentLoader / RoomRuntimeCache / chunk-warm
  // scheduler; nothing on the failing path is mocked.
