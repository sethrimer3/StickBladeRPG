/**
 * roomCacheManifest.ts — Room cache manifest types and validation utilities.
 *
 * The room cache manifest (`manifest.json`) lives in the ROOMS/ directory
 * alongside the individual room files.  It records which room files exist,
 * their content hashes, and the campaign metadata needed to detect staleness.
 *
 * Source-of-truth hierarchy (never invert this):
 *   1. Campaign file (.sbcampaign.json) — canonical, human-shareable.
 *   2. manifest.json               — derived; tracks room-file state.
 *   3. Individual room files        — derived; generated from the campaign.
 *
 * Consequences:
 *   - Never edit room files or manifest.json manually.
 *   - Always regenerate from "Export Campaign" in the Electron editor.
 *   - If manifest is missing or stale, regenerate from the campaign file.
