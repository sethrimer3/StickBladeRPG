/**
 * roomComplexity.ts — authoritative room/campaign performance-complexity analyzer.
 *
 * A single source of truth for estimating how expensive a room is to render/
 * simulate, used by:
 *   - the editor's in-progress density warnings (via editorRoomComplexity.ts,
 *     which adapts `EditorRoomData` into the same category-count shape),
 *   - the (optional) editor density indicator,
 *   - the custom-campaign pre-play warning (`analyzeCampaignComplexity`),
 *   - tests.
 *
 * The analysis is purely a count/sum over already-serialized room data — it
 * never instantiates entities, runs simulation, or touches the renderer, so
 * it is safe to call on rooms that have never been loaded/visited.
 *
 * Two numbers are reported per room:
 *   - `totalPlacedCount`  — a raw count of discretely-placed entities. Useful
 *     for "N placed elements" style messaging, but NOT a good performance
 *     proxy on its own (a wall is far cheaper than a scene light).
 *   - `weightedScore`     — `totalPlacedCount`-like categories AND derived
 *     magnitude categories (e.g. total enemy particle count, total liquid
 *     cell area), each multiplied by a per-category cost weight
 *     (`CONTENT_COMPLEXITY_WEIGHTS`) and summed. This is the number severity
 *     tiers and "should warn" decisions are based on.

// ── Weights ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Estimated relative runtime cost per unit of each category, used to compute
 * `weightedScore`. Deliberately named/exported so nothing scatters ad-hoc
 * numeric thresholds elsewhere (editor input handlers, campaign-launch code,
 * etc.) — this module is the only place these numbers should live.
 *
 * Rationale (see report for the full write-up):
 *   - tiles            — cheapest per-unit: static geometry, batched into the
 *                         wall template/chunk cache at load time.
 *   - objects          — mixed bag of mostly-static collectibles/decorations
 *                         plus a few lightweight physics bodies; moderate.
 *   - enemies          — AI tick + physics + collision + rendering per enemy;
 *                         one of the most expensive per-unit categories.
 *   - enemyParticles   — fine-grained per-particle cost within an enemy's
 *                         simulated body (bosses are large here even though
 *                         `enemies` count stays low).
 *   - dustCells        — each authored sand/dust pixel becomes a live
 *                         falling-sand simulation cell; noticeably pricier
 *                         than a static tile.
 *   - liquidCells       — liquid simulation is cheaper per-cell than sand but
 *                         zones are typically large-area, so it adds up.
 *   - emitterParticles — motes/swirls/piles are continuously
 *                         animated/attracted; moderate per-particle cost.
 *   - hazards          — per-frame collision/zone tests against the player.
 *   - triggers         — mostly idle bounding-box checks; cheap.
 *   - lights           — most expensive per-unit: scene lights run
 *                         visibility-polygon shadow casting every frame.
