/**
 * roomRuntimeCache.ts — Bounded LRU cache for per-room static runtime data.
 *
 * Caches:
 *  - `RoomWallTemplate` — result of the expensive O(n²) wall-merge pass.
 *  - Ambient-light blocker key sets — built inline on cache miss.
 *  - Wall decorations — pure geometry, no mutable state.
 *
 * EdgeExtensionCache is no longer built during normal gameplay (legacy feature).
 * The `edgeExtension` field is kept in `RoomRuntimeEntry` for legacy compatibility
 * but is always `null` in normal gameplay.  See src/render/transitions/legacy/README.md.
 *
 * Both wall templates and blocker sets can be built ahead of time for rooms near
 * the player via `roomPreloadScheduler.ts`, so that when the player crosses a
 * transition the expensive work is already done and `_makeLoadRoomPhases` only
 * copies data rather than recomputing it.
 *
 * Cache invalidation:
 *  - Call `invalidate(roomId)` when a room is edited (editor reload callback).
 *  - Call `invalidateAll()` to reset for save/load round-trips.
 *
 * BUILD 388
