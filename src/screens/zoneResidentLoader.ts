/**
 * zoneResidentLoader.ts — Zone-level resident world and asset preparation.
 *
 * Builds and maintains resident WorldStates, decoded sprites, decoded
 * backgrounds, and entry-viewport render chunk prewarms for every room in
 * the active worldNumber zone.  Goals:
 *
 *  1. Intra-zone transitions use residentWorldHot and never show entryWarm.
 *  2. Cross-zone transitions show a loading screen, prepare the new zone
 *     before gameplay resumes, then activate the target room.
 *  3. Old-zone residents are evicted after a safe handoff period.
 *
 * Readiness criteria for a zone to be fully ready (isZoneReady()):
 *  1. Every room's resident WorldState is built  (runtimeReady === true).
 *  2. Every room's theme sprites are decoded      (areRoomSpritesReady()).
 *  3. Every room's background image is decoded    (isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady()).
 *
 * Entry-viewport chunk prewarm is kicked off via addZoneEntryViewportTasks()
 * but does NOT gate zone readiness — it completes asynchronously via the idle
 * scheduler alongside the build loop.
 *
 * Usage (gameScreen.ts):
 *   const zoneLoader = new ZoneResidentLoader(ROOM_REGISTRY, roomRuntimeCache);
 *
 *   // Startup:
 *   zoneLoader.startZoneLoad(startingWorldNumber, residentRoomManager, campaignSeed);
 *   // Each RAF frame while zone is loading:
 *   const done = zoneLoader.tickZoneLoad(residentRoomManager, campaignSeed);
 *   const prog = zoneLoader.getZoneProgress();   // for overlay text
 *
 *   // Cross-zone transition:
 *   zoneLoader.startZoneLoad(targetWorldNumber, residentRoomManager, campaignSeed);
 *   // ... tick loop as above ...
 *
 *   // After zone transition:
 *   zoneLoader.evictInactiveZoneResidents(activeWorldNumber, residentRoomManager);
 *
 * BUILD 430
