/**
 * roomTransitionLoadCoordinator.ts — Room-transition execution lifecycle.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from the `startGameScreen` closure in gameScreen.ts
 * (BUILD 442, phase three of the architectural refactor).  Owns everything
 * that happens AFTER `gameRoomTransitionOrchestrator` decides the player has
 * crossed a transition boundary and emits a transition request:
 *
 *  - transition-path selection with fixed precedence:
 *      (1) cross-zone deferral (different worldNumber),
 *      (2) resident-world hot-swap (valid prebuilt resident),
 *      (3) prepared instant load (fully prepared runtime cache),
 *      (4) async cache-miss load (generator spread across RAF frames);
 *  - the async room-load state (formerly `asyncLoadState`) and the
 *    one-generator-phase-per-frame advancement contract;
 *  - the captured pre-transition velocity (formerly `_preTransVX/_preTransVY`),
 *    exposed to the load generator for Phase-F prewarm ordering and applied to
 *    the new player cluster (deferred until generator completion on the async
 *    path, immediate on the hot/instant paths, never twice);
 *  - the pending cross-zone activation record (`ZoneTransitionState`) and the
 *    zone-load tick that re-issues the deferred transition once the target
 *    zone is ready (capture-then-clear so the cross-zone guard cannot recurse);
 *  - resident-world registration/invalidation sequencing around each path;
 *  - transition-mode and hot-swap miss-reason classification, readiness
 *    diagnostics, and transition-profiler begin/end calls;
 *  - starting or skipping the entry-viewport warm with the same coverage
 *    criteria as before;
 *  - the blocking-gameplay contract: `isBlockingGameplay()` is true while an
 *    async load or a cross-zone load is in progress; the RAF loop must skip
 *    sim/input/render-gameplay frames and reset its frame clock afterwards so
 *    frozen load time is never charged to physics or the speedrun timer.
 *
 * ## Ordering invariants (preserved from the closure implementation)
 *
 *  - player-state capture BEFORE player detachment (hot-swap);
 *  - detachment BEFORE freezing the outgoing world (hot-swap);
 *  - outgoing-world freeze BEFORE replacing the active world;
 *  - outgoing resident invalidation BEFORE in-place target loading
 *    (instant and async paths);
 *  - active-world replacement immediately followed by the `setWorld` port
 *    (which must also update `loadRoomCtx.world`) BEFORE resident activation;
 *  - generator completion BEFORE deferred velocity application (async);
 *  - cross-zone pending-state clearing (takePendingActivation) BEFORE the
 *    target activation re-issue;
 *  - resident registration BEFORE neighborhood-readiness recalculation;
 *  - the caller resets its frame-delta accumulator after blocking frames.
 *
 * ## Ownership and lifetime
 *
 * One instance per `startGameScreen` call; discard with `reset()` in the
 * screen's cleanup function.  `reset()` abandons the in-flight generator and
 * any pending cross-zone activation.
 *
 * ## Allowed dependencies
 *
 * Node-safe imports only (movement constants, ZoneTransitionState,
 * bfsNearbyRooms, types).  Everything with a DOM- or renderer-facing import
 * graph (room loading, resident activation, entry warm, chunk prewarm
 * diagnostics, the loading overlay, the transition profiler) is injected via
 * `RoomTransitionLoadCoordinatorDeps` as narrow structural ports — which is
 * also what makes the path-selection state machine testable under plain
 * `node --test`.  This module must never import gameScreen.ts.
