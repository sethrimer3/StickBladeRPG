/**
 * roomRenderChunkWarmScheduler.ts — Idle-time render-chunk pre-warmer.
 *
 * Uses spare CPU/GPU time during active gameplay to pre-build wall and
 * background render chunks for nearby rooms before the player enters them.
 * When the player does enter a room with pre-warmed chunks, `adoptPrewarmedWallChunks`
 * and `adoptPrewarmedBgChunks` inject the pre-built canvases into the active
 * caches, eliminating the first-frame hitch.
 *
 * Priority order:
 *   1. Radius-1 rooms (directly adjacent) — entrance viewport first.
 *   2. Radius-2 rooms — entrance viewport only, when machine is fast.
 *   3. Radius-3 rooms — only on high quality + stable frame times.
 *
 * Safety rules:
 *   - Only runs during `requestIdleCallback` (or setTimeout fallback) slots.
 *   - Checks `timeRemaining()` and stops before the budget is exhausted.
 *   - Backs off or pauses when recent frame times are poor.
 *   - Cancelled and restarted on every room transition.
 *
 * BUILD 561
