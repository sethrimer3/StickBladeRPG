# StickBlade Agent Guide

This file is the short entry point for coding agents. Keep it compact and update it when repo workflow or architecture changes.

## Required read order

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/AI_REPO_MAP.md`
3. `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`
4. `docs/Todo.md`
5. Existing detailed docs as needed: `README.md`, `nextSteps.md`, `docs/decisions/performanceOptimizationDecisions.md`, `docs/decisions/REFACTORING_PLAN.md`, `docs/render-chunk-prewarming.md`, `docs/README.md` (documentation index), and any feature-specific notes.

## Working rule for token-efficient agents

Read the map and status first. Identify the smallest relevant subsystem, then inspect only the needed source files and their immediate dependencies. Do not scan unrelated systems unless a concrete import, data dependency, or failing test points there.

When uncertain, say so and verify with source. Do not infer behavior from old planning notes if current source contradicts them.

## Validation commands

From `package.json`:

```bash
npm run build
npm run lint
npm test
```

Useful dev commands:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run preview
npm run electron
npm run desktop
```

`npm run electron` and `npm run desktop` include `--no-sandbox` for local Electron development.

## StickBlade-specific boundaries

- Simulation code under `src/sim/` should stay deterministic. Avoid wall-clock randomness or DOM/render dependencies in simulation logic.
- Rendering should read snapshots and runtime room data, not mutate simulation state.
- Room loading, resident-room activation, and transition geometry are sensitive. Prefer small, measured changes.
- Do not casually change `mapSketchRenderer.ts`, `buildCompleteBoundaryWalls`, or transition trigger geometry. These areas are called out in `nextSteps.md` as regression-prone.
- Room transitions use complete boundary walls plus independent trigger strips. Do not reintroduce boundary holes.
- For documentation-only changes, do not modify source code, saved room data, version numbers, or build numbers unless an existing repo rule explicitly requires it.
- Every coherent set of codebase changes made by an AI agent must increment the patch component of `BUILD_NUMBER` in `src/build-info.ts` exactly once (for example, `1.0.0` becomes `1.0.1`). The main menu displays this value. Documentation-only changes do not require a bump unless they accompany code changes.
- Follow the operational workflow in `docs/Todo.md` when selecting or completing Todo tasks. Record useful unfinished implementation context in `nextSteps.md`; check off a Todo only when its core acceptance criteria are complete.

## How to make changes

1. State the subsystem you are touching.
2. Inspect the files named in `docs/AI_REPO_MAP.md` for that task type.
3. Make the smallest coherent change.
4. Run the narrowest useful validation first, then the full validation commands when practical.
5. Report changed files, validation results, and any uncertain areas.

## Main-only AI and auto-sync policy

See [`docs/AUTOSYNC_WORKFLOW.md`](docs/AUTOSYNC_WORKFLOW.md) for commands and recovery details.

- All AI coding work is performed directly on `main`. Do not create, switch to, or push a feature branch, and do not open a pull request, unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Before editing, confirm `main` is checked out. When the tree is clean, update it with a safe fast-forward-only pull.
- Before investigation that could lead to edits, choose a unique task lease ID (for example `codex-<new-guid>`), retain that exact ID for the entire task, and run `powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/pause-autosync.ps1 -LeaseId <task-lease-id> -Owner Codex -Purpose "<short task>"`. Require exit code 0. A lease file alone is insufficient: do not edit unless the helper confirms auto-sync is quiescent. Keep your lease through investigation, implementation, focused/full validation, commit, synchronization, and push.
- Make one coherent commit. Synchronize safely (normally `git pull --rebase origin main`), resolve conflicts manually, and push without force to `origin/main`.
- After confirming the completed commit exists on `origin/main`, release only your task's lease with `powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/resume-autosync.ps1 -LeaseId <task-lease-id>`, then run `scripts/autosync-status.ps1`. Do not end a successful task until your lease is absent and you have reported whether other leases still keep auto-sync paused.
- If work is interrupted, validation fails, a conflict occurs, or push/verification fails, leave your lease in place and report its exact ID plus the repository state. Incomplete work must remain uncommitted.
- Never discard unrelated local changes, never force-push `main`, and never use auto-sync as the agent's final commit mechanism.
- Work is not complete merely because it exists locally; completion requires confirmation on `origin/main`.
- Existing feature branches are preserved until they are manually reviewed. Do not delete or merge them as part of routine AI work.
