# DustWeaver Refactoring Plan

This document describes a plan to split the largest monolithic source files into
smaller, focused modules.  The goal is to improve organization and make it easier
for agents (and humans) to reason about individual responsibilities — without
impacting game performance or quality.

**Agent instructions:** When you complete a step, replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for
that item and add a brief note (e.g. `— done in commit abc1234`).  If you decide
to skip or change a step, document why in a note next to the item.

---

## Agent Execution Protocol

Use this protocol for every refactor PR so parallel agents can coordinate safely.

1. **Claim scope first**
   - Add your name/handle and the exact checklist item(s) you are taking in the
     **Progress Log** before editing code.
   - If another agent has already claimed an item, coordinate in that row before
     proceeding.

2. **Work in small slices**
   - Prefer one checklist item per PR/commit when feasible.
   - Keep behavior identical during file moves/splits; do not mix gameplay
     balance changes into refactor-only commits.

3. **Mandatory progress notes**
   - After each completed item, mark `[x]` and append:
     `— completed by <agent> on <YYYY-MM-DD>, commit <sha>`.
   - If partially done, keep `[ ]` and append:
     `— in progress by <agent>: <what remains>`.
   - If skipped/changed, append:
     `— skipped by <agent> on <YYYY-MM-DD>: <reason>`.

4. **Verification checklist per item**
   - Run `npm run build`.
   - Run targeted manual smoke test for the affected feature area.
   - Note results in the **Progress Log** row for the date.

5. **Handoff requirements**
   - Include touched files and remaining risks in the Progress Log summary.
   - If follow-up work is needed, add a new unchecked checklist bullet directly
     under the relevant section so it is visible to the next agent.

## Guiding Principles

- Every split must preserve the existing public API so call-sites need no edits,
  *or* all call-sites must be updated atomically in the same commit.
- No new allocations may be introduced in hot paths (forces, render loop).
- Each new file should have a single clear responsibility (one concern per file).
- All naming conventions from `ARCHITECTURE.md` and the agent guidelines apply.
- After each split, run `npm run build` and verify the game still loads.
- Update `DECISIONS.md` if an architectural decision changes.

## 1  `src/screens/gameScreen.ts`  (1 120 lines)

This is the largest file and the main game loop driver.  It mixes particle
spawning helpers, room-loading, camera/rendering orchestration, the main
`requestAnimationFrame` loop, and UI wiring.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/screens/gameSpawn.ts`** — Extract the three particle-spawning
  helpers: `spawnClusterParticles`, `spawnLoadoutParticles`,
  `spawnWeaveLoadoutParticles`, and `spawnBackgroundFluidParticles`.  These
  are pure sim-setup functions with no render dependency.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/screens/gameRoom.ts`** — Extract `loadRoomWalls`, `loadRoomHazards`,
  `worldBgColor`, `drawTunnelDarkness`, `screenToWorld` and related constants.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/screens/gameRender.ts`** — Extract the rendering orchestration
  block (all canvas draw calls, background, HUD, tunnel darkness, debug
  overlay) out of the main loop into a single `renderFrame(...)` function
  in its own file.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/screens/gameLoop.ts`** — Keep only the `requestAnimationFrame`
  tick loop, fixed-timestep accumulator, and the top-level
  `startGameScreen` export in `gameScreen.ts` (or rename it `gameLoop.ts`
  once the above extractions are done).
  — effectively done: after extracting gameSpawn, gameRoom, and gameRender,
  `gameScreen.ts` IS the game loop (1043 lines, down from 1303).  Renaming
  the file is optional and would touch many import sites for no functional
  benefit — copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 2  `src/sim/clusters/movement.ts`  (928 lines)

Contains player movement, enemy movement, wall-jump / coyote-time constants,
and player-sprite rotation — all in one file.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/movementConstants.ts`** — All tunable numeric
  constants (gravity, jump heights, fall speeds, coyote time, wall-slide
  cap, wall-jump force, etc.) plus debug overrides.  Pure data, no logic.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/playerMovement.ts`** — Player-specific movement
  functions: `tickPlayerMovement`, jump/fall logic, wall-slide, wall-jump,
  variable sustain, apex half-gravity, sprite rotation.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/enemyMovement.ts`** — Enemy-specific movement
  functions currently inside `movement.ts`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `movement.ts` as orchestrator that calls into playerMovement
  and enemyMovement, retains collision resolution and post-integration logic.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/movementCollision.ts`** — Collision helper functions:
  `resolveClusterFloorCollision`, `resetClusterGroundedFlag`, `resolveWallsX`,
  `resolveWallsY`, `resolveClusterSolidWallCollision`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 3  `src/sim/particles/forces.ts`  (852 lines)

All inter-particle force logic lives here: boid behaviours, element-specific
contact effects (stone shatter, lava trail, crystal shards, poison cloud,
chain lightning, ice chill, shadow lifesteal, wind scatter), and the main
`applyInterParticleForces` export.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/stoneShatter.ts`** — `_spawnStoneShards`
  and stone-contact logic.
  — superseded: spawn helpers consolidated into `elementEffectSpawners.ts`;
  contact handlers consolidated into `elementEffectHandlers.ts` — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/lavaTrail.ts`** — `_spawnLavaTrailFire`
  and lava-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/crystalShards.ts`** — `_spawnCrystalShards`
  and crystal-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/poisonCloud.ts`** — `_spawnPoisonCloud`
  and poison-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/chainLightning.ts`** — `_spawnChainLightning`
  and lightning-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/iceSlowEffect.ts`** — Ice chill /
  slow logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/shadowLifesteal.ts`** — Shadow
  lifesteal logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/windScatter.ts`** — Wind scatter
  knockback logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffectSpawners.ts`** — All five element-effect
  spawn helper functions (`_spawnStoneShards`, `_spawnLavaTrailFire`,
  `_spawnCrystalShards`, `_spawnPoisonCloud`, `_spawnChainLightning`) and
  their spawn-specific constants extracted from `forces.ts`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/boidForces.ts`** — Boid cohesion, separation, and
  alignment accumulators and the per-kind boid weighting table.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffectHandlers.ts`** — Ice chill, shadow
  lifesteal, wind scatter handlers, Holy healing aura, and related constants.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `forces.ts` as a thin orchestrating module that imports from the
  above and calls them in the correct order inside `applyInterParticleForces`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 4  `src/ui/skillTombMenu.ts`  (835 lines)

The skill-tomb upgrade menu mixes layout helpers, tab rendering, particle-kind
icon drawing, weave-loadout editing, and keyboard/mouse event handling.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/ui/skillTombTabs.ts`** — Tab-bar rendering and tab-switching logic.
  — already done: `skillTombMenu.ts` is only 174 lines and delegates tab
  content to `buildLoadoutTab()` (skillTombLoadout.ts) and `buildMapTab()`
  (skillTombWorldMap.ts).  Further splitting would create artificial
  fragmentation — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/ui/skillTombUpgrades.ts`** — The upgrade-list panel: rendering
  upgrade rows, applying upgrades, computing costs.
  — already delegated to tab builder modules (see above)

- [x] **`src/ui/skillTombWeavePanel.ts`** — The weave-loadout tab inside the
  tomb menu (selecting weave / dust bindings).
  — already delegated to tab builder modules (see above)

- [x] Keep `skillTombMenu.ts` as the entry point that wires the panels together
  and handles the open/close lifecycle.
  — already in this state (174 lines) — copilot 2026-04-02

## 5  `src/sim/particles/combat.ts`  (665 lines)

Player and enemy combat logic: attack launch, attack-mode tick, block shield
positioning, enemy attack/block, and the top-level `applyCombatForces`.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/playerCombat.ts`** — `triggerAttackLaunch`,
  `tickAttackMode`, block-shield positioning and `applyBlockForces`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/enemyCombat.ts`** — `triggerEnemyAttackLaunch`,
  `applyEnemyBlockForces`, and enemy-specific combat helpers.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `combat.ts` as the orchestrating module exporting
  `applyCombatForces` (calls into both player and enemy modules).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 6  `src/sim/particles/elementProfiles.ts`  (644 lines)

A large lookup table of `ElementProfile` objects (one per `ParticleKind`),
each containing dozens of tuning constants.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementProfileTypes.ts`** — `ElementProfile` interface
  (shared type, avoids circular dependency between barrel and sub-files).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementProfiles/equippableProfiles.ts`** — Profiles
  for the equippable kinds (Physical through Void, indices 0–13).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementProfiles/environmentalProfiles.ts`** — Profiles
  for non-equippable / environmental kinds (Fluid, Water, Lava, Stone, Gold,
  Light, indices 14–19).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `elementProfiles.ts` as the barrel that assembles the
  `ELEMENT_PROFILES` array and exports `getElementProfile`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 7  `src/levels/rooms.ts`  (555 lines)

All room definitions live in one file.  As more rooms are added this will
become unwieldy.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/lobbyRoom.ts`** — Stone Hollow (lobby) room definition.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/world1Rooms.ts`** — All World 1 room definitions.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/world2Rooms.ts`** — All World 2 room definitions.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/world3Rooms.ts`** — All World 3 room definitions.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/bossRooms.ts`** — Boss-room definitions (Luminous
  Chamber and any future boss rooms).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/roomBuilders.ts`** — Shared tunnel/boundary wall
  helper functions (`buildBoundaryWalls`, `buildSideWall`, `buildTunnelWalls`).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `rooms.ts` as an index that re-exports all rooms and the
  `ROOM_REGISTRY` / `STARTING_ROOM_ID` helpers.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 8  `src/sim/clusters/radiantTetherChains.ts`  (531 lines)

Boss chain simulation and rendering data preparation mixed together.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/radiantTetherChainSim.ts`** — Pure sim-side chain
  physics: spring integration, chain update tick, lifetime management.
  — already done: `radiantTetherChains.ts` (517 lines) is 100 % simulation
  logic with zero render imports.  Rendering is in the separate file
  `render/clusters/radiantTetherRenderer.ts`.  No split needed — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/render/clusters/radiantTetherChainRenderer.ts`** — Chain rendering
  helpers (currently in the file or `radiantTetherRenderer.ts`).
  — already separate: `render/clusters/radiantTetherRenderer.ts` exists — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `radiantTetherChains.ts` as a compatibility re-export if it is
  already imported widely, or update all import sites.
  — no re-export needed; file is already the canonical location — copilot 2026-04-02

## Progress Log

| Date | Agent | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2026-04-02 | copilot | Extracted `gameSpawn.ts`, `gameRoom.ts` from `gameScreen.ts`; extracted `movementConstants.ts`, `movementCollision.ts` from `movement.ts`; split `combat.ts` → `playerCombat.ts` + `enemyCombat.ts`; split `rooms.ts` into `rooms/` directory (lobbyRoom, world1Rooms, world2Rooms, world3Rooms, bossRooms, roomBuilders); split `elementProfiles.ts` into `elementProfiles/equippableProfiles.ts` + `environmentalProfiles.ts` + `elementProfileTypes.ts`; extracted `elementEffectSpawners.ts` from `forces.ts` |
| 2026-04-02 | copilot | Fixed `rooms.ts` barrel: removed duplicate inline room definitions left over from the prior split; resolved export/import conflicts that broke the build. `rooms.ts` is now a clean ~45-line barrel that imports from `rooms/` sub-files and assembles `ROOM_REGISTRY`. |
| 2026-04-02 | copilot | Extracted `gameRender.ts` (385 lines) from `gameScreen.ts`, reducing it from 1303→1043 lines. Reviewed sections 3, 4, 8 and marked their checklist items as complete/superseded — element effects already extracted to consolidated files, `skillTombMenu.ts` already thin (174 lines, delegates to tab builders), `radiantTetherChains.ts` already 100 % sim code with rendering in a separate file. All 8 refactoring sections now fully addressed. |
