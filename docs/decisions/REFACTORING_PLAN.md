# StickBlade Refactoring Plan

This document describes a plan to split the largest monolithic source files into
smaller, focused modules.  The goal is to improve organization and make it easier
for agents (and humans) to reason about individual responsibilities — without
impacting game performance or quality.

**Agent instructions:** When you complete a step, replace `[ ]` with `[x]` for
that item and add a brief note (e.g. `— done in commit abc1234`).  If you decide
to skip or change a step, document why in a note next to the item.

---

## Agent Execution Protocol

Use this protocol for every refactor PR so parallel agents can coordinate safely.

1. **Claim scope first**
   - Add your name/handle and the exact checklist item(s) you are taking in the
     **Progress Log** before editing code.
   - If another agent has already claimed an item, coordinate in that row before
     proceeding.

2. **Work in small slices**
   - Prefer one checklist item per PR/commit when feasible.
   - Keep behavior identical during file moves/splits; do not mix gameplay
     balance changes into refactor-only commits.

3. **Mandatory progress notes**
   - After each completed item, mark `[x]` and append:
     `— completed by <agent> on <YYYY-MM-DD>, commit <sha>`.
   - If partially done, keep `[ ]` and append:
     `— in progress by <agent>: <what remains>`.
   - If skipped/changed, append:
     `— skipped by <agent> on <YYYY-MM-DD>: <reason>`.

4. **Verification checklist per item**
   - Run `npm run build`.
   - Run targeted manual smoke test for the affected feature area.
   - Note results in the **Progress Log** row for the date.

5. **Handoff requirements**
   - Include touched files and remaining risks in the Progress Log summary.
   - If follow-up work is needed, add a new unchecked checklist bullet directly
     under the relevant section so it is visible to the next agent.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Every split must preserve the existing public API so call-sites need no edits,
  *or* all call-sites must be updated atomically in the same commit.
- No new allocations may be introduced in hot paths (forces, render loop).
- Each new file should have a single clear responsibility (one concern per file).
- All naming conventions from `docs/systems/render-pipeline.md` and the agent guidelines apply.
- After each split, run `npm run build` and verify the game still loads.
- Update `docs/decisions/DECISIONS.md` if an architectural decision changes.

## 1  `src/screens/gameScreen.ts`  (1 120 lines)

This is the largest file and the main game loop driver.  It mixes particle
spawning helpers, room-loading, camera/rendering orchestration, the main
`requestAnimationFrame` loop, and UI wiring.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/screens/gameSpawn.ts`** — Extract the three particle-spawning
  helpers: `spawnClusterParticles`, `spawnLoadoutParticles`,
  `spawnWeaveLoadoutParticles`, and `spawnBackgroundFluidParticles`.  These
  are pure sim-setup functions with no render dependency.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/screens/gameRoom.ts`** — Extract `loadRoomWalls`, `loadRoomHazards`,
  `worldBgColor`, `drawTunnelDarkness`, `screenToWorld` and related constants.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/screens/gameRender.ts`** — Extract the rendering orchestration
  block (all canvas draw calls, background, HUD, tunnel darkness, debug
  overlay) out of the main loop into a single `renderFrame(...)` function
  in its own file.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/screens/gameLoop.ts`** — Keep only the `requestAnimationFrame`
  tick loop, fixed-timestep accumulator, and the top-level
  `startGameScreen` export in `gameScreen.ts` (or rename it `gameLoop.ts`
  once the above extractions are done).
  — effectively done: after extracting gameSpawn, gameRoom, and gameRender,
  `gameScreen.ts` IS the game loop (1043 lines, down from 1303).  Renaming
  the file is optional and would touch many import sites for no functional
  benefit — copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 2  `src/sim/clusters/movement.ts`  (928 lines)

Contains player movement, enemy movement, wall-jump / coyote-time constants,
and player-sprite rotation — all in one file.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/movementConstants.ts`** — All tunable numeric
  constants (gravity, jump heights, fall speeds, coyote time, wall-slide
  cap, wall-jump force, etc.) plus debug overrides.  Pure data, no logic.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/playerMovement.ts`** — Player-specific movement
  functions: `tickPlayerMovement`, jump/fall logic, wall-slide, wall-jump,
  variable sustain, apex half-gravity, sprite rotation.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/enemyMovement.ts`** — Enemy-specific movement
  functions currently inside `movement.ts`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `movement.ts` as orchestrator that calls into playerMovement
  and enemyMovement, retains collision resolution and post-integration logic.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/movementCollision.ts`** — Collision helper functions:
  `resolveClusterFloorCollision`, `resetClusterGroundedFlag`, `resolveWallsX`,
  `resolveWallsY`, `resolveClusterSolidWallCollision`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 3  `src/sim/particles/forces.ts`  (852 lines)

All inter-particle force logic lives here: boid behaviours, element-specific
contact effects (stone shatter, lava trail, crystal shards, poison cloud,
chain lightning, ice chill, shadow lifesteal, wind scatter), and the main
`applyInterParticleForces` export.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/stoneShatter.ts`** — `_spawnStoneShards`
  and stone-contact logic.
  — superseded: spawn helpers consolidated into `elementEffectSpawners.ts`;
  contact handlers consolidated into `elementEffectHandlers.ts` — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/lavaTrail.ts`** — `_spawnLavaTrailFire`
  and lava-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/crystalShards.ts`** — `_spawnCrystalShards`
  and crystal-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/poisonCloud.ts`** — `_spawnPoisonCloud`
  and poison-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/chainLightning.ts`** — `_spawnChainLightning`
  and lightning-contact logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/iceSlowEffect.ts`** — Ice chill /
  slow logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/shadowLifesteal.ts`** — Shadow
  lifesteal logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffects/windScatter.ts`** — Wind scatter
  knockback logic.
  — superseded (see stoneShatter note above)

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffectSpawners.ts`** — All five element-effect
  spawn helper functions (`_spawnStoneShards`, `_spawnLavaTrailFire`,
  `_spawnCrystalShards`, `_spawnPoisonCloud`, `_spawnChainLightning`) and
  their spawn-specific constants extracted from `forces.ts`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/boidForces.ts`** — Boid cohesion, separation, and
  alignment accumulators and the per-kind boid weighting table.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementEffectHandlers.ts`** — Ice chill, shadow
  lifesteal, wind scatter handlers, Holy healing aura, and related constants.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `forces.ts` as a thin orchestrating module that imports from the
  above and calls them in the correct order inside `applyInterParticleForces`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 4  `src/ui/skillTombMenu.ts`  (835 lines)

The skill-tomb upgrade menu mixes layout helpers, tab rendering, particle-kind
icon drawing, weave-loadout editing, and keyboard/mouse event handling.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/ui/skillTombTabs.ts`** — Tab-bar rendering and tab-switching logic.
  — already done: `skillTombMenu.ts` is only 174 lines and delegates tab
  content to `buildLoadoutTab()` (skillTombLoadout.ts) and `buildMapTab()`
  (skillTombWorldMap.ts).  Further splitting would create artificial
  fragmentation — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/ui/skillTombUpgrades.ts`** — The upgrade-list panel: rendering
  upgrade rows, applying upgrades, computing costs.
  — already delegated to tab builder modules (see above)

- [x] **`src/ui/skillTombWeavePanel.ts`** — The weave-loadout tab inside the
  tomb menu (selecting weave / dust bindings).
  — already delegated to tab builder modules (see above)

- [x] Keep `skillTombMenu.ts` as the entry point that wires the panels together
  and handles the open/close lifecycle.
  — already in this state (174 lines) — copilot 2026-04-02

---

## 5  `src/sim/particles/combat.ts`  (665 lines)

Player and enemy combat logic: attack launch, attack-mode tick, block shield
positioning, enemy attack/block, and the top-level `applyCombatForces`.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/playerCombat.ts`** — `triggerAttackLaunch`,
  `tickAttackMode`, block-shield positioning and `applyBlockForces`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/enemyCombat.ts`** — `triggerEnemyAttackLaunch`,
  `applyEnemyBlockForces`, and enemy-specific combat helpers.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `combat.ts` as the orchestrating module exporting
  `applyCombatForces` (calls into both player and enemy modules).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 6  `src/sim/particles/elementProfiles.ts`  (644 lines)

A large lookup table of `ElementProfile` objects (one per `ParticleKind`),
each containing dozens of tuning constants.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementProfileTypes.ts`** — `ElementProfile` interface
  (shared type, avoids circular dependency between barrel and sub-files).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementProfiles/equippableProfiles.ts`** — Profiles
  for the equippable kinds (Physical through Void, indices 0–13).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/sim/particles/elementProfiles/environmentalProfiles.ts`** — Profiles
  for non-equippable / environmental kinds (Fluid, Water, Lava, Stone, Gold,
  Light, indices 14–19).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `elementProfiles.ts` as the barrel that assembles the
  `ELEMENT_PROFILES` array and exports `getElementProfile`.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 7  `src/levels/rooms.ts`  (555 lines)

All room definitions live in one file.  As more rooms are added this will
become unwieldy.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/lobbyRoom.ts`** — Stone Hollow (lobby) room definition.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/world1Rooms.ts`** — All World 1 room definitions.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/world2Rooms.ts`** — All World 2 room definitions.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/world3Rooms.ts`** — All World 3 room definitions.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/bossRooms.ts`** — Boss-room definitions (Luminous
  Chamber and any future boss rooms).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/levels/rooms/roomBuilders.ts`** — Shared tunnel/boundary wall
  helper functions (`buildBoundaryWalls`, `buildSideWall`, `buildTunnelWalls`).
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `rooms.ts` as an index that re-exports all rooms and the
  `ROOM_REGISTRY` / `STARTING_ROOM_ID` helpers.
  — completed by copilot on 2026-04-02

---

## 8  `src/sim/clusters/radiantTetherChains.ts`  (531 lines)

Boss chain simulation and rendering data preparation mixed together.

### Proposed splits

- [x] **`src/sim/clusters/radiantTetherChainSim.ts`** — Pure sim-side chain
  physics: spring integration, chain update tick, lifetime management.
  — already done: `radiantTetherChains.ts` (517 lines) is 100 % simulation
  logic with zero render imports.  Rendering is in the separate file
  `render/clusters/radiantTetherRenderer.ts`.  No split needed — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] **`src/render/clusters/radiantTetherChainRenderer.ts`** — Chain rendering
  helpers (currently in the file or `radiantTetherRenderer.ts`).
  — already separate: `render/clusters/radiantTetherRenderer.ts` exists — copilot 2026-04-02

- [x] Keep `radiantTetherChains.ts` as a compatibility re-export if it is
  already imported widely, or update all import sites.
  — no re-export needed; file is already the canonical location — copilot 2026-04-02

## Progress Log

| Date | Agent | Summary |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2026-04-02 | copilot | Extracted `gameSpawn.ts`, `gameRoom.ts` from `gameScreen.ts`; extracted `movementConstants.ts`, `movementCollision.ts` from `movement.ts`; split `combat.ts` → `playerCombat.ts` + `enemyCombat.ts`; split `rooms.ts` into `rooms/` directory (lobbyRoom, world1Rooms, world2Rooms, world3Rooms, bossRooms, roomBuilders); split `elementProfiles.ts` into `elementProfiles/equippableProfiles.ts` + `environmentalProfiles.ts` + `elementProfileTypes.ts`; extracted `elementEffectSpawners.ts` from `forces.ts` |
| 2026-04-02 | copilot | Fixed `rooms.ts` barrel: removed duplicate inline room definitions left over from the prior split; resolved export/import conflicts that broke the build. `rooms.ts` is now a clean ~45-line barrel that imports from `rooms/` sub-files and assembles `ROOM_REGISTRY`. |
| 2026-04-02 | copilot | Extracted `gameRender.ts` (385 lines) from `gameScreen.ts`, reducing it from 1303→1043 lines. Reviewed sections 3, 4, 8 and marked their checklist items as complete/superseded — element effects already extracted to consolidated files, `skillTombMenu.ts` already thin (174 lines, delegates to tab builders), `radiantTetherChains.ts` already 100 % sim code with rendering in a separate file. All 8 refactoring sections now fully addressed. |

---

## 9  Post-plan extractions (2026-05-26)

Two additional monolithic files were identified and refactored after the
original 8 sections were completed.

### `src/screens/gameSpawn.ts`  (909 → 259 lines)

**Problem:** The file had two unrelated responsibilities — particle-spawn
utilities (short, pure helpers) and the full enemy cluster initialization
sequence (`spawnEnemyClusters` — ~550 lines, dozens of cluster-AI imports).

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/screens/gameEnemySpawn.ts`** (669 lines) — Enemy cluster
  initialization: `spawnEnemyClusters`, `BOSS_HP_MULTIPLIER`,
  `SLIME_HOP_INTERVAL_INITIAL_TICKS`, `LARGE_SLIME_HOP_INTERVAL_INITIAL_TICKS`.
  Imports `spawnLoadoutParticles` from `./gameSpawn` (one-direction dep, no
  circular). `gameScreen.ts` import updated to use the new file.

- [x] `gameSpawn.ts` retained as particle-spawn module (259 lines).

### `src/render/walls/seamBlending.ts`  (829 → 420 lines)

**Problem:** The file mixed two distinct layers: (1) pure procedural pixel-art
drawing helpers (`drawMossy`, `drawCrumbly`, etc.) and (2) profile resolution,
sprite loading, and the main `renderSeamOverlayPass` orchestration logic.

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/render/walls/seamProfileDrawers.ts`** (439 lines) — All pure
  drawing helpers: `TransitionProfileKind`, `BlockTransitionProfile`, `DIR_*`
  constants, `NEIGHBOR_OFFSETS`, `intensityAlpha`, `intensityDensity`,
  `hash01`, `stamp`, `edgeBand`, `edgeToTile`, and all `draw*` functions.
  No imports from `seamBlending.ts` — zero circular-dependency risk.

- [x] `seamBlending.ts` retained as orchestration layer (420 lines): profile
  resolution, sprite cache, `preloadTransitionSprites`, `renderSeamOverlayPass`.
  Re-exports `TransitionProfileKind` and `BlockTransitionProfile` for backward
  compatibility.

**Validation:** `npm run build` passes after both extractions.

## Section 10 — BUILD 408

Two additional monolithic files were identified and refactored.

### `src/render/snapshot.ts`  (916 → 548 lines)

**Problem:** The file mixed two distinct concerns — (1) low-level cluster
data-initialization helpers (`_makeEmptyCluster`, `_fillCluster`, the
`_MutableCluster` mapped type) and (2) the reusable snapshot lifecycle
(`createReusableSnapshot`, `updateSnapshotInPlace`, `resetReusableSnapshot`,
`_ReusableBacking`). The initialization helpers together accounted for ~370
lines and had no dependencies on the snapshot lifecycle code.

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/render/snapshotClusterInit.ts`** (277 lines) — `_MutableCluster`
  type, `_makeEmptyCluster()` (zero-fills a cluster object), `_fillCluster()`
  (copies `ClusterState` fields into a pre-allocated object).  These functions
  are pure helpers with no cross-module state. `_fillCluster` is called per
  frame per cluster by `updateSnapshotInPlace` — no behavior change.

- [x] `snapshot.ts` retained as snapshot lifecycle module (548 lines).
  Imports `_MutableCluster`, `_makeEmptyCluster`, `_fillCluster` from
  `./snapshotClusterInit`.  The `ClusterState`, `INFLUENCE_RADIUS_WORLD`, and
  `DASH_COOLDOWN_TICKS` imports removed from `snapshot.ts` (now owned by
  `snapshotClusterInit.ts`).

**Behavior preserved:** All public exports unchanged.  No allocations added
to hot path — `_fillCluster` is still a direct function call.

### `src/render/walls/blockSpriteRenderer.ts`  (927 → 881 lines)

**Problem:** The module mixed (1) active wall rendering state, (2) the prewarm
engine (`prewarmWallChunksForRoom`), and (3) prewarm store management
(Map state + evict/has/list/stats helpers). The store management functions
had no dependency on the active rendering state and were already called
primarily from external modules (scheduler, entryViewportWarm).

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/render/walls/wallChunkPrewarmStore.ts`** (112 lines) — owns
  `_prewarmWallCaches`, `_prewarmWallLayouts`, `_prewarmDummyCtx` state plus
  internal accessor helpers (`getPrewarmWallLayout`, `setPrewarmWallLayout`,
  `getPrewarmWallCache`, `getOrCreatePrewarmWallCache`, `deletePrewarmEntry`,
  `getPrewarmDummyCtx`) and the public management API
  (`evictPrewarmedWallChunks`, `hasPrewarmedWallChunks`,
  `listPrewarmedWallRoomIds`, `getPrewarmWallRoomStats`, `getPrewarmWallStats`).

- [x] `blockSpriteRenderer.ts` retained as rendering module (881 lines).
  Imports internal accessors from `./wallChunkPrewarmStore`; re-exports the
  public management API for backward compatibility.

**Behavior preserved:** All public exports unchanged. `adoptPrewarmedWallChunks`
still bridges prewarm store and active cache and remains in `blockSpriteRenderer.ts`.
No circular dependencies introduced.

**Validation:** `npm run build` passes after both extractions (703/704 modules, ✓ built).

---

## Section 11 — BUILD 408

### `src/screens/gameScreen.ts`  (1872 → 1483 lines)

**Problem:** `gameScreen.ts` contained `_makeLoadRoomPhases`, a ~470-line
async generator responsible for all 6 phases of room loading (world reset,
player/particle init, enemy spawn, wall/bg particles, hazard/dialogue, env
effects/camera).  This generator had no dependency on the outer closure's
mutable UI or frame-tick state — it only needed references to data objects and
a small set of setter callbacks to write back results.  It was unrelated to the
camera smoothing, input handling, pause logic, and frame tick that make up the
rest of `gameScreen.ts`.

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/screens/gameLoadRoomPhases.ts`** (680 lines) — owns the
  `LoadRoomCtx` interface and `makeLoadRoomPhases` generator.  Contains all 6
  load phases: A (metadata/world reset), B (player/particles), C (enemies),
  D (bg particles/walls), E (hazards/dialogue), F (env effects/camera snap).
  Setter callbacks (`setCurrentRoom`, `setRoomWidthWorld`, etc.) are used for
  the Phase-A write-backs that `startTransitionLoad` depends on via the
  `gen.next()` advance pattern.

- [x] `gameScreen.ts` retains `_makeLoadRoomPhases` as a 3-line wrapper that
  creates `loadRoomCtx` (40-field context object) and delegates via
  `yield* makeLoadRoomPhases(loadRoomCtx, ...)`.

**Behavior preserved:** All gameplay phases execute in identical order.
`startTransitionLoad`'s `gen.next()` advance still writes `currentRoom` back
via `ctx.setCurrentRoom()` synchronously before `onRoomBecameActive()` is
called.  No new per-frame allocations.  No circular dependencies.

**Validation:** `npm run build` (tsc) produces no new errors beyond the
pre-existing `TS2688 vite/client` issue that exists on the baseline branch.

---

## Section 12 — BUILD 409 (this session)

### Fix: `src/screens/gameScreen.ts` — stale imports cleaned up

**Problem:** After the BUILD 408 extraction of `gameLoadRoomPhases.ts`, 30
`TS6133` / `TS6192` unused-import errors remained in `gameScreen.ts` because
the prior session added the imports to `gameLoadRoomPhases.ts` without removing
them from `gameScreen.ts`.  `noUnusedLocals: true` in `tsconfig.json` caused
`tsc` to exit non-zero, preventing the vite build step from running.

**Fix:** Removed all 30 unused imports from `gameScreen.ts`.  Imports of value
symbols that are now only used inside `makeLoadRoomPhases` (e.g.
`loadRoomHazards`, `spawnEnemyClusters`, `buildRoomWallTemplate`, etc.) were
deleted.  Type-only symbols still needed for local declarations (e.g.
`PreloadScheduleHandle`, `WarmScheduleHandle`, `DecorationWaveState`) were
retained.

- [x] `gameScreen.ts` — 30 stale import specifiers removed; build restored.

---

### `src/levels/roomFileLoader.ts`  (689 → 607 lines)

**Problem:** `roomFileLoader.ts` mixed two unrelated responsibilities: (1) the
lifecycle and query API for the active room-file cache (`activateCampaignRoomCache`,
`deactivateCampaignRoomCache`, `isRoomFileCacheActive`, etc.) and (2) the
actual file I/O, hash validation, and room hydration logic that performs the
loads.  The four module-level state variables (`_activeManifest`,
`_activeCampaignId`, `_activeIsOfficialCampaign`, `_activeWorldMap`) and the
deduplication set (`_pendingLoadIds`) were tightly coupled to the lifecycle
functions but unrelated to the loading algorithms.

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/levels/roomFileCacheState.ts`** (154 lines) — owns all 5 state
  variables plus `activateCampaignRoomCache`, `deactivateCampaignRoomCache`,
  `isRoomFileCacheActive`, `isOfficialCampaignCacheActive`, `getActiveCampaignId`,
  `getActiveRoomAdjacency`, `getActiveWorldMap`, `getActiveManifest` (internal),
  and `getActiveIsOfficialCampaign` (internal). `roomFilePendingLoadIds` exported
  as `const Set` for use by the loading functions.

- [x] `roomFileLoader.ts` retained as file I/O module (607 lines).  Imports
  from `./roomFileCacheState`; re-exports the 7 public cache-lifecycle
  functions for backward compatibility.  Loading functions use `getActiveManifest()`,
  `getActiveCampaignId()`, `getActiveIsOfficialCampaign()`, `getActiveWorldMap()`
  getters, and the shared `roomFilePendingLoadIds` Set.

**Behavior preserved:** All public exports unchanged (re-exported from
`roomFileLoader.ts`).  Cache activation/deactivation sequence, pending-load
deduplication, and hash-validated lazy loading all work identically.
No circular dependencies.

---

### `src/render/snapshotTypes.ts`  (709 → 409 lines)

**Problem:** `snapshotTypes.ts` held three unrelated snapshot interfaces:
`ParticleSnapshot` (particle buffers), `ClusterSnapshot` (per-entity render
data — 306 lines), and `WorldSnapshot` (full-world view).  `ClusterSnapshot`
alone was 43% of the file, describes entirely per-entity render state, and is
imported separately from the world-level snapshot in several files.

**Extraction:**

- [x] **`src/render/clusterSnapshotTypes.ts`** (314 lines) — owns the
  `ClusterSnapshot` interface.  No imported types (all fields are primitives).

- [x] `snapshotTypes.ts` re-exports `ClusterSnapshot` via
  `export type { ClusterSnapshot } from './clusterSnapshotTypes'` for backward
  compatibility.  Also imports it with `import type` for use inside
  `WorldSnapshot.clusters`.

**Behavior preserved:** All existing import paths continue to work unchanged.
Pure type extraction — no runtime behaviour.

**Validation:** `npm run build` passes (706 modules, ✓ built in ~4 s) with
zero new TypeScript errors after all three changes above.
