# Render Chunk Prewarming

StickBlade prebakes wall and background render chunks for nearby rooms while the
player is in the current room.  This means the first frames of a room transition
are served from already-built canvases rather than cold-built tiles, eliminating
the first-entry hitch on large rooms.

---

## How it works

### 1 — Room preload pipeline

When the player enters a room `scheduleRoomPreloads` queues nearby rooms for
data + sprite loading (`roomPreloadScheduler.ts`).  After those items are
scheduled, `scheduleChunkPrewarms` (from `roomRenderChunkWarmScheduler.ts`) is
called with the same room graph.  It queues chunk-warm tasks for:

- **Radius 1** – rooms directly connected by a transition.
- **Radius 2** – rooms one hop beyond those.
- **Radius 3** – two hops beyond (only when `graphics = 'high'` or frame time
  is consistently low).

### 2 — Idle-time scheduling

The warmer runs exclusively during browser idle time via `requestIdleCallback`
(with a `setTimeout(fn, 0)` fallback on browsers that lack it, which fires at
the next event-loop tick with a synthetic 50 ms time budget).

Each idle callback:
1. Checks whether the average frame time is above `FRAME_TIME_PAUSE_THRESHOLD_MS`
   (default 20 ms / 50 fps).  If so, it reschedules without doing any work.
2. Processes at most `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_IDLE` (default 6) chunks per callback, and
   stops early if `timeRemaining()` drops below `MIN_IDLE_REMAINING_MS`
   (default 4 ms) — whichever limit is hit first.
3. Schedules another callback if work remains.

No chunk building ever happens during a normal game-render frame.

### 3 — Chunk-warm tasks

For each room in the queue the warmer computes likely-visible chunks using the
**entrance viewport**:

```
camera centred on the arrival spawn block
  → offsetXPx = vpWidth/2  − spawnX × scalePx
  → offsetYPx = vpHeight/2 − spawnY × scalePx
```

Visible chunks in that viewport are queued first; then a one-chunk margin around
them; then the rest of the room (working outward).  For radius-2/3 rooms only
the entrance chunks are queued unless there is plenty of idle time.

### 4 — Renderer integration

Two renderers expose prewarm APIs:

| Renderer | Prewarm function | Adopt on entry |
|---|---|---|
| `blockSpriteRenderer` | `prewarmWallChunksForRoom` | `adoptPrewarmedWallChunks` |
| `backgroundBlockRenderer` | `prewarmBgChunksForRoom` | `adoptPrewarmedBgChunks` |

**Prewarm** saves/restores all module-level render state so the active room is
never disturbed.  Each room's warmed chunks are stored in a separate
`RoomChunkCache` instance keyed by room ID.

**Adopt** (`adoptPrewarmedChunksForRoom` in the scheduler, called from
`gameLoadRoomPhases.ts` Phase A) injects the warmed caches into the live
renderers at transition time. Before staged wall/background adoption, both
active caches atomically switch to an ownership key containing room ID,
render-state key, and scale. Changing ownership clears all prior canvases, so
partial adoption cannot leave untouched chunk coordinates from the outgoing
room. The adopted canvases themselves are handed off without re-allocation.
Hit/miss counters are updated for the debug panel.

Every chunk canvas is also tagged with its cache content generation. Coverage
and extraction reject dirty, fallback-built, or wrong-generation entries.
When the gameplay rebuild budget is exhausted, dirty or missing chunks draw a
deterministic dark placeholder and remain pending; an existing dirty canvas is
never blitted. This same policy applies to same-room edits and settings changes
because correctness is preferred over briefly presenting obsolete artwork.

### 5 — Sprite readiness gate

Chunks are only built once `areRoomSpritesReady(roomId)` returns `true`.  Tasks
that are not yet sprite-ready are skipped and re-queued (up to
`MAX_SPRITE_WAIT_RETRIES` times, default 5).  This prevents fallback grey
rectangles from being baked into cached canvases.

### 6 — Room / quality invalidation

When `scheduleChunkPrewarms` is called again (e.g. the player changes rooms), it
cancels any in-flight handle and starts fresh.  Warmed caches from a previous
session are evicted for rooms that are no longer in the new work queue.
Graphics-quality changes are handled because `scalePx` is baked into each cache;
a zoom/quality change clears incompatible canvases on first use rather than
retaining prior-scale images as dirty fallbacks.

## Constants

All tuning constants live near the top of
`src/screens/roomRenderChunkWarmScheduler.ts`.

| Constant | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_IDLE` | `6` | Maximum chunks built in a single idle callback. |
| `MIN_IDLE_REMAINING_MS` | `4` | Stop processing if `timeRemaining()` drops below this. |
| `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | `requestIdleCallback` timeout — the browser must invoke the callback within this many ms even if the system is busy. |
| `FRAME_TIME_PAUSE_THRESHOLD_MS` | `20` | Pause all prewarming when mean frame time exceeds this (≈50 fps). |
| `MAX_PREWARM_RADIUS` | `3` | Maximum BFS radius from the current room. |
| `RADIUS3_HIGH_QUALITY_ONLY` | `true` | Limit radius-3 warming to `graphics='high'` or stable frame times. |

Renderer-side constants live near the top of each renderer file:
- `blockSpriteRenderer.ts` — `_prewarmWallCaches` / `_prewarmWallLayouts` maps
  (unbounded; LRU eviction is handled by the scheduler on room change).
- `backgroundBlockRenderer.ts` — `_prewarmBgCaches` map.

## Debug stats (Prewarm panel)

Enable the overlay by pressing the debug-panel key in-game and activating the
**Prewarm** panel (or toggle `debugPanelManager` defaults in code).

| Stat | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **queue** | Number of warm tasks still pending. |
| **wall chunks** | Total warmed wall chunk canvases in memory. |
| **bg chunks** | Total warmed background chunk canvases in memory. |
| **warmed/slice** | Chunks built in the last idle callback. |
| **ms/slice** | Wall-clock time spent in the last idle callback. |
| **radius** | Current BFS radius (1–3) being worked on. |
| **hits / misses** | Chunk-cache hits and misses recorded on the most recent room entry. |
| **paused (frame time)** | Shown when prewarming is suspended due to high frame time. |

## Tuning guide

**Warmer feels too aggressive (stutter during gameplay)**
- Reduce `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_IDLE` (try 2–3).
- Lower `FRAME_TIME_PAUSE_THRESHOLD_MS` (try 16 ms / 60 fps).
- Increase `MIN_IDLE_REMAINING_MS` (try 8 ms).

**Transitions still hitch on slow hardware**
- Increase `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_IDLE` slightly.
- Lower `FRAME_TIME_PAUSE_THRESHOLD_MS` so the warmer runs at lower performance
  margins (careful — this risks stutter on weak machines).

**Radius-3 rooms are wasted CPU**
- Set `MAX_PREWARM_RADIUS = 2` to disable three-hop warming entirely.
- Or leave `RADIUS3_HIGH_QUALITY_ONLY = true` (default) so it only runs when
  `graphics = 'high'`.

**Memory concerns**
- Each warmed chunk canvas is typically `~2–4 KB` for a 32×32 px tile at zoom
  1.0.  A full 30-chunk room × 2 layers × 5 rooms ≈ ~1 MB.
- The current implementation evicts all non-adjacent warmed rooms when the
  scheduler is re-initialized on room change.  For tighter memory control,
  implement `evictStalePrewarmedChunks` (currently a no-op stub in the
  scheduler) with an LRU size cap.

## Known limitations / next steps

- **LRU memory cap** (`evictStalePrewarmedChunks`) is currently a no-op stub.
  Implement it if memory growth is observed after walking through many rooms.
- Radius-3 warming only gates on `graphics='high'` today; a future improvement
  could also gate on `getLastFrameMs() < FRAME_TIME_PAUSE_THRESHOLD_MS` to be
  fully adaptive.
- The prewarm panel is now exposed both as a toggle option in the pause-menu debug section (`pauseMenu.ts`) when Debug Mode is enabled, and as a toggle button on the floating debug menu (`debugPanel.ts`).
