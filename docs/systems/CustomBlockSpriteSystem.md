# Custom Block Sprite System

Campaign-local pixel-art blocks that fill a 1×1 or 2×2 tile footprint, collide as solid walls, and survive export and campaign relocation.

---

## Phase 1A Audit Findings

The following gaps or defects were found in the Phase 1A implementation and addressed in Phase 1B.

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Pencil/eraser strokes had no Bresenham interpolation — fast mouse movement skipped pixels | Medium | Fixed |
| 2 | Canvas `mouseleave` ended the stroke instead of a global `mouseup` — dragging outside the canvas cut the stroke short | Medium | Fixed |
| 3 | `isSafeCampaignRelativePath` did not reject `http://`, `file://`, `//UNC` paths | Medium | Fixed |
| 4 | Library management missing: no Rename, Duplicate, or usage-count display | High | Fixed |
| 5 | Gameplay never registered custom block sprite cache — custom sprites were invisible during gameplay (blocks appeared as blackRock walls) | Medium | Fixed (registry now populated on campaign load) |
| 6 | No reconciliation utility to compare registry vs room references | Medium | Fixed |
| 7 | No `CustomBlockSpriteSystem.md` documentation | — | Fixed (this file) |

**Not defects (working correctly in Phase 1A):**
- Collision via baked wall template works in editor and gameplay.
- Undo/redo grouping (one undo entry per stroke) was correct.
- Flood fill was iterative (stack-based) — no stack-overflow risk.
- Export round-trip preserves IDs and RGBA values.
- Campaign schema includes `customBlockDefs?` array.
- Missing-block fallback renders conspicuous magenta/black checkerboard.

---

## Schema and Folder Layout

Custom block definitions are stored **inline** in the packed campaign JSON (`*.sbcampaign.json`) under the top-level `customBlockDefs` array. No separate folder or file-per-block layout is used; the entire custom-block library travels with the campaign.

> **Note:** the shape below is the legacy schemaVersion-1 format, kept for compatibility. See "Phase 2A: Safe Predefined Properties" further down for the current schemaVersion-2 format (`properties` object replaces `behavior`), which is what the editor now writes on every save.

### Per-block JSON shape

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "weathered-stone",           // stable slug: [a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]
  "name": "Weathered Stone",         // display name (mutable, ID is stable)
  "tileWidth": 1,                    // 1 or 2
  "tileHeight": 1,                   // 1 or 2
  "pixelWidth": 8,                   // tileWidth × 8
  "pixelHeight": 8,                  // tileHeight × 8
  "behavior": "solid",               // always "solid"
  "pixels": [                        // pixelHeight rows × pixelWidth columns
    ["#FF0000FF", "#00FF00FF", ...], // row 0
    ...
  ]
}
```

Colors are canonical uppercase `#RRGGBBAA` hex strings only.

---

## Stable ID Rules

- Generated from the display name at creation time via `nameToSlugId`: lowercase, hyphens only, trimmed.
- If the slug collides, `-2`, `-3`, … are appended until unique.
- The ID never changes after creation — rename changes only the `name` field.
- IDs must match `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$|^[a-z0-9]$/`.
- The namespaced form `custom:<id>` is used in room references and palette items.
- IDs must not collide with any built-in block type (namespacing via `custom:` prefix ensures this).

---

## Library Management Behavior

### Create
The `+1×1` / `+2×2` buttons in the Custom Blocks palette open the pixel editor dialog. On save, the block is added to the campaign-local registry and its sprite is cached.

### Edit sprite
The `✏ Edit` button opens the pixel editor with the existing pixels. On save, the registry entry and cached sprite are both updated. All placed instances reflect the new sprite immediately (they share the same cached canvas).

### Rename
The `✎ Rename` button prompts for a new display name. Only the `name` field changes; the `id` and all room references remain unchanged.

### Duplicate
The `⧉ Dup` button creates a new block with:
- A new unique ID (original ID + suffix)
- Display name: `<original> Copy`
- An independent copy of the pixel buffer (mutations to one do not affect the other)

### Delete
The `🗑` button checks all rooms (committed + current in-editor) for placements. If the block is in use, deletion is blocked with a list of affected rooms. If unused, the block is removed from the registry and its sprite cache entry is released.

### Usage count
Each block card displays how many rooms contain at least one placement of that block. This is recomputed when blocks are created, deleted, or duplicated.

---

## 2×2 Placement Representation

A 2×2 placement is stored as a single `[xBlock, yBlock, "custom:<id>"]` entry in `room.customBlockPlacements`. The `tileWidth` and `tileHeight` fields on the runtime `EditorCustomBlockPlacement` object are derived from the registry at room-load time.

For collision, the placement is converted to a solid `RoomWallDef` with `wBlock: tileWidth, hBlock: tileHeight` in `editorRoomBuilder.ts`. The wall is then baked into the room's `bakedWallTemplate` on export and used by both editor and gameplay.

Overlap checking during placement uses the full `tileWidth × tileHeight` footprint.

---

## Validation Rules

`validateCustomBlockSource` enforces:

1. `schemaVersion === 1`
2. `id` matches the safe-slug regex
3. `name` is a non-empty, non-whitespace string
4. `tileWidth` ∈ {1, 2}; `tileHeight` ∈ {1, 2}
5. `pixelWidth === tileWidth × 8`; `pixelHeight === tileHeight × 8`
6. `behavior === "solid"`
7. `pixels` has exactly `pixelHeight` rows, each with exactly `pixelWidth` uppercase `#RRGGBBAA` strings

Errors stop further validation after a `schemaVersion` mismatch; pixel errors are capped at 20 to avoid flooding on large corrupt files.

---

## Path Security

`isSafeCampaignRelativePath(path)` rejects:

- Empty paths
- Windows absolute paths (`C:\…`)
- Unix absolute paths (`/…`, `\…`)
- UNC paths (`//server`, `\\server`)
- Parent traversal (`..`)
- Reserved characters: `< > " | ? *`
- Null bytes and control characters (U+0000–U+001F)
- URI schemes (`http://`, `file://`, `ftp://`, etc.)

Custom blocks are JSON data only and must never execute code. The `parseCustomBlockSource` validator rejects all non-`"solid"` behavior strings.

---

## Persistence Behavior

Custom block definitions are saved as part of the campaign JSON via `buildExportCampaign`. The flow:

1. The editor holds the registry in `state.customBlockRegistry` (in-memory only).
2. On export (`onExportCampaignJson`), all registry entries are serialized to `CustomBlockSourceDef[]` and passed to `buildExportCampaign`, which includes them in the output as `customBlockDefs`.
3. On campaign load (editor or gameplay), each `customBlockDef` entry is validated via `parseCustomBlockSource`. Malformed entries are skipped with a warning; they do not abort the load.

There is no per-block file — all blocks travel in the single campaign JSON, so the usual atomic-file-write semantics of the campaign exporter protect the whole library.

---

## Runtime Caching and Cleanup

The sprite cache (`src/render/customBlockSpriteCache.ts`) is a module-level `Map<string, CustomBlockSprite>` keyed by raw block ID.

- **One canvas per definition**: all placed instances of the same block share the same cached `HTMLCanvasElement` / `OffscreenCanvas`. No pixel parsing happens during rendering.
- **Register**: `registerCustomBlockSprite(def)` builds the canvas and stores it.
- **Targeted invalidation**: `invalidateCustomBlockSprite(def)` removes the old canvas and calls `registerCustomBlockSprite` to rebuild only that block's sprite.
- **Rename without pixel change**: does not call `invalidateCustomBlockSprite` — the cached canvas is still valid.
- **Delete**: `invalidateCustomBlockSprite` removes the cache entry for the deleted block.
- **Campaign switch / editor close**: `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` clears the entire cache.
- **Gameplay start**: custom block defs are registered in the sprite cache when a packed campaign is loaded for play (in `game.ts`), so sprites are available for any overlay renderer that draws them.

---

## Missing-Reference Behavior

When a room references a block ID not in the registry:

- The `EditorCustomBlockPlacement` retains the original `blockId` string.
- `tileWidth` and `tileHeight` fall back to `1` (their cached value is not updated for unknown blocks).
- `getOrFallbackSprite` returns a conspicuous magenta/black checkerboard sprite and caches it under the missing ID to avoid rebuilding every frame.
- The wall is still baked as a solid collision tile at `[xBlock, yBlock]` with a 1×1 footprint unless the footprint was preserved in the room data.
- A diagnostic warning is logged.
- The missing block is never silently replaced with a different block.

The `reconcileCustomBlocks` utility can be called to compare the registry against all room references and report:
- `room_reference_not_in_registry` — a room uses a block not in the registry.
- `registry_missing_from_room_usage` — a block is defined but never placed.

---

## Import, Export, and Portability

- Export bundles all `customBlockDefs` inline in the campaign JSON — no separate asset files.
- On reload from a different directory, all custom block definitions are present in the JSON; no path resolution is needed.
- Stable IDs and uppercase hex colors are deterministic across machines and OS.
- Deleted blocks are not included in new exports (only the live registry is serialized).
- Malformed blocks in an imported campaign are skipped with a warning; the rest of the campaign loads normally.

---

## Performance Limits

No explicit file-count or per-block file-size limits are enforced in Phase 1B. The practical limit is the campaign JSON file size (limited by the exporter's memory and the browser's local-storage quota for imported campaigns). Extremely large pixel buffers (e.g., hundreds of 2×2 blocks) will slow export and camera.

---

## Phase 1C: Gameplay Rendering, Unsaved-Change Protection, Symlink Containment

### Gameplay Rendering Path

Custom block sprites are now drawn during gameplay and editor-backdrop rendering.

**Flow:**
1. Campaign load → `game.ts` calls `registerCustomBlockSprite(def)` for every `customBlockDef`.
2. `roomJsonToRoomDef.ts` copies `json.customBlockPlacements` into `RoomDef.customBlockPlacements`.
3. Every `gameRender.ts` frame: after `renderWalls(...)`, `renderCustomBlockSprites(ctx, currentRoom, ox, oy, zoom)` is called.
4. For each placement: `getOrFallbackSprite(rawId, 1, 1)` looks up the cached canvas; the returned sprite's own `tileWidth`/`tileHeight` fields drive the destination rectangle.
5. `drawCustomBlockSprite` calls `ctx.drawImage` with `imageSmoothingEnabled = false` for nearest-neighbor scaling.
6. The editor-backdrop renderer (`gameScreenEditorBackdrop.ts`) follows the same call after `renderWalls`.

**Why after walls:** the standard wall renderer draws blackRock tiles for every solid tile including custom block footprints. Custom sprites paint over those tiles without needing to suppress the underlying wall draw, keeping the wall renderer untouched.

### Cached Sprite Integration

- One `OffscreenCanvas` (or `HTMLCanvasElement`) per block ID — created once at campaign load, or after a sprite edit.
- `invalidateCustomBlockSprite(def)` + `registerCustomBlockSprite(def)` replaces the cached canvas on save. All future frame draws see the new sprite automatically.
- `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` is called on campaign unload, preventing stale sprites from leaking to the next campaign.
- Multiple placements of one block always retrieve the same object via `getOrFallbackSprite`.

### Transparency and Layering Behavior

- `imageSmoothingEnabled = false` ensures exact RGBA sampling; no color blending across pixel boundaries.
- Fully transparent and semitransparent pixels are preserved exactly as painted (alpha channel passed through `putImageData`).
- No background is drawn beneath transparent pixels from this renderer — the underlying wall tile (blackRock) appears through them. If the designer wants an opaque block, they should paint all pixels with `alpha = 255`.
- Z-order: custom sprites render above walls and below clusters, hazards, and particles (same as decorations).

### Cache Invalidation Behavior

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Edit + save a block | `invalidateCustomBlockSprite(def)` deletes the old entry; `registerCustomBlockSprite(def)` builds a new canvas |
| Campaign unload | `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` clears all entries |
| Campaign switch | Cache is cleared before loading the new campaign — no ID collisions possible |
| Missing block ID at render time | `getOrFallbackSprite` returns a cached magenta/black checkerboard; caches it to avoid per-frame rebuild |

### Unsaved-Change Handling

`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts` tracks dirty state:

- `savedPixelData` — snapshot of the pixel data at dialog open time.
- `isDirty()` — byte-wise comparison of `pixelData` vs `savedPixelData`.
- **Cancel** and **Escape**: if `isDirty()`, a confirmation sub-dialog appears with three choices:
  - **Save & Close**: validates → serializes → calls `onResult({ action: 'save', … })` → clears dirty state.
  - **Discard Changes**: closes dialog without saving → `onResult({ action: 'cancel' })`.
  - **Keep Editing**: dismisses the confirmation and returns to the pixel editor.
- If nothing was changed, Cancel/Escape closes immediately without prompting.
- A failed save (validation error) keeps the dialog open and leaves `pixelData` intact.
- `savedPixelData.set(pixelData)` is called after a successful save to clear dirty status.

### Symlink Containment Strategy

`electron/campaignExport.cjs` now includes `checkPathInsideCampaignDir(targetPath, allowedDir, label)`:

1. Resolves `allowedDir` with `fs.realpathSync` (symlink-aware).
2. Resolves `targetPath` with `fs.realpathSync`; if the path does not yet exist, walks up to the nearest existing ancestor.
3. Checks that the resolved target path starts with the resolved allowed dir.
4. Returns `{ ok: false, error, realTarget, realAllowed }` on violation.

This check is applied at the campaign write path, packed campaign file, individual room writes, and stale room file deletion. `isSafeCampaignRelativePath` (lexical) remains unchanged and is the first layer; `checkPathInsideCampaignDir` is the second, symlink-aware layer.

**Platform limitation (Windows):** Windows requires elevated privileges or Developer Mode to create symlinks unprivileged. The symlink-escape test detects this and logs a diagnostic instead of failing. The lexical checks (`isSafeCampaignRelativePath`, `SAFE_ROOM_ID_RE`) remain effective on all platforms.

---

## Test Results

Phase 1C adds **23 additional tests** in `src/tests/customBlocksPhase1C.test.ts` covering:

- Sprite registered and retrievable after `registerCustomBlockSprite` (gameplay not blackRock)
- Exact RGBA bytes (including semitransparent and fully transparent) preserved
- 1×1 sprite has 1×1 tileWidth/tileHeight; 2×2 has 2×2
- Multiple placements → same cached object reference
- Missing definition → fallback checkerboard sprite (not null)
- Campaign switch clears cache → no cross-campaign sprite leak
- `invalidateCustomBlockSprite` + re-register updates all future lookups
- Dirty-state: unchanged buffer not dirty; edited pixel marks dirty
- Discard restores persisted state; save clears dirty state; failed save preserves edits
- Symlink escape rejected for paths outside allowed dir; legitimate subpaths accepted
- Built-in rooms without `customBlockPlacements` are skipped by renderer (field = undefined)
- RGBA round-trip fidelity for semitransparent and fully transparent pixels
- Existing lexical path checks unchanged

Phase 1B tests: 59 in `src/tests/customBlocks.test.ts`.

**Total test suite after Phase 1C: 760 tests, 0 failures.**

---

## Manual Smoke Test

The Electron dev server was not available in this environment (Windows Home, requires PowerShell elevation for symlinks; browser dev mode was not started). The following checks were performed by code inspection:

| Check | Method | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Custom sprites render in gameplay | Code: `renderCustomBlockSprites` called in `gameRender.ts` after `renderWalls` | ✅ Wired |
| Editor backdrop also draws sprites | Code: same call in `gameScreenEditorBackdrop.ts` | ✅ Wired |
| `customBlockPlacements` flows from JSON to RoomDef | Code: `roomJsonToRoomDef.ts` now copies the field | ✅ Confirmed |
| Cancel with unsaved changes shows prompt | Code: `attemptCancel()` checks `isDirty()` before acting | ✅ Wired |
| Discard restores saved state | Code: `discardBtn` calls `onResult({ action: 'cancel' })` without save | ✅ Wired |
| Symlink escape rejected | Tests: `checkPathInsideCampaignDir` tested with temp dir | ✅ Tested |
| Type checking | `npx tsc --noEmit` | ✅ 0 errors |
| Production build | `npm run build` | ✅ Success |
| Full test suite | `npm test` | ✅ 760 pass, 0 fail |

**Manual browser/Electron run was not performed.** Blocking factor: Electron requires a running desktop session and the test environment does not have one active during this session.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Undo history is bounded at 50 but not per-block isolated.** The undo stack is local to one open dialog session; it is always empty when the dialog opens. Undoing back to the persisted state does not clear dirty status (the undo stack does not track which state corresponds to the last save).

2. **No cross-campaign ID namespace collision detection.** If two campaigns define the same block ID, importing them together would be ambiguous.

3. **Windows symlink limitation.** `checkPathInsideCampaignDir` fully protects against symlink escape on Linux and macOS. On Windows, unprivileged symlinks require Developer Mode or elevation; if those are unavailable, the symlink check still runs but cannot be triggered by an attacker who also cannot create symlinks. The lexical checks remain fully effective on all platforms.

4. **Transparent pixels reveal the underlying wall tile.** Since `renderCustomBlockSprites` draws over blackRock tiles without erasing them first, transparent pixels in a custom block will show the blackRock tile through them. This is intentional (saves a clear pass) but means designers must use alpha = 255 for fully opaque blocks if they don't want the blackRock edge visible.

---

## Phase 2A: Safe Predefined Properties

Custom blocks can now carry an engine-defined `properties` object selecting **collision**, **friction**, and **breakability** presets. No scripts, callbacks, shaders, or arbitrary physics numbers are involved — every preset id maps to an existing, already-shipped engine behavior.

### Schema Version 2

```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "id": "weathered-stone",
  "name": "Weathered Stone",
  "tileWidth": 1,
  "tileHeight": 1,
  "pixelWidth": 8,
  "pixelHeight": 8,
  "properties": {
    "collision": "solid",       // "solid" | "oneWay" | "nonSolid"
    "friction": "default",      // "default" | "slippery"
    "breakability": "indestructible" // "indestructible" | "fragile"
  },
  "pixels": []
}
```

`behavior: "solid"` (schemaVersion 1) is replaced by the `properties` object in schemaVersion 2. `CUSTOM_BLOCK_SCHEMA_VERSION` is now `2`; the parser still accepts `1` (`CUSTOM_BLOCK_MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION`).

### Version-1 Compatibility

- `validateCustomBlockSource` accepts `schemaVersion` `1` or `2`. Version-1 blocks are validated exactly as before (`behavior === "solid"` required); version-2 blocks validate the `properties` object instead and ignore `behavior`.
- `parseCustomBlockSource` always resolves a full `CustomBlockProperties` bundle. For a version-1 block with no `properties` field, `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties(undefined, …)` returns the defaults `{ collision: "solid", friction: "default", breakability: "indestructible" }` with **zero** diagnostics — this is exactly the old Phase-1 behavior, not a fallback-from-error path.
- Editing and saving a version-1 block through the editor always writes it back out as schemaVersion 2 (`serializeCustomBlock` only emits v2). Room references (`custom:<id>`) are untouched by this upgrade.

### Property Registry (`src/levels/customBlockProperties.ts`)

The registry is the single authoritative source for both validation and editor UI. For each preset it defines:

- **Serialized id** (`'solid' | 'oneWay' | 'nonSolid'`, etc.)
- **Display label** and **editor description** (`COLLISION_PRESET_REGISTRY`, `FRICTION_PRESET_REGISTRY`, `BREAKABILITY_PRESET_REGISTRY`)
- **Validation**: `isCollisionPreset` / `isFrictionPreset` / `isBreakabilityPreset` type guards; `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties` never throws — unknown values fall back to the default and are reported as a `CustomBlockValidationError` (`field`, `expected`, `received`, `blockId`).
- **Compatibility rules**: `checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility(properties, tileWidth, tileHeight)` returns a list of violated rules; never silently rewrites anything itself.
- **Runtime behavior mapping**: `resolveWallBehavior(properties)` returns `{ generateWall, isPlatformFlag, platformEdge, blockTheme }` built entirely from existing `RoomWallDef` fields. `isEligibleForBreakablePathway(properties, tileWidth, tileHeight)` decides whether a placement should be routed to the existing breakable-block system.
- **Default value**: `DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES = { collision: 'solid', friction: 'default', breakability: 'indestructible' }`.

JSON never names an internal class or module — only a preset id string, which this registry maps to behavior.

### Implemented Presets and the Existing Pathways They Reuse

| Property | Preset | Existing engine pathway reused |
|---|---|---|
| Collision | `solid` (default) | Ordinary `RoomWallDef` wall, `isPlatformFlag: 0` — unchanged from Phase 1. |
| Collision | `oneWay` | `RoomWallDef.isPlatformFlag = 1`, `platformEdge = 0` (top) — the same one-way platform resolution already used by `resolveWallsY`/`resolveWallsX` in `src/sim/clusters/movementAxisResolvers.ts`. |
| Collision | `nonSolid` | No wall is generated for the placement at all (parallel to `RoomBackgroundBlockDef`'s "visual only, no collision" behavior) — collision resolvers never see it, but the sprite still renders via `customBlockPlacements`. |
| Friction | `default` | `RoomWallDef.blockTheme = 'blackRock'` — unchanged. |
| Friction | `slippery` | `RoomWallDef.blockTheme = 'ice'` — the same ice-surface low-friction acceleration/deceleration constants in `src/sim/clusters/movementConstants.ts` (`ICE_GROUND_ACCELERATION_PER_SEC2`, `ICE_GROUND_DECELERATION_PER_SEC2`), applied via the existing `wallIsIceFlag` derivation. No new friction number is introduced. |
| Breakability | `indestructible` (default) | No special handling — an ordinary solid/one-way/non-solid wall. |
| Breakability | `fragile` | The block's placement is **not** added to the normal wall array. Instead its `(xBlock, yBlock)` is pushed into `RoomDef.breakableBlocks`, which `gameRoomHazards.ts` already turns into its own wall plus a `world.breakableBlockXWorld/…/isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` entry using the existing momentum-threshold destruction logic (`BREAKABLE_MOMENTUM_THRESHOLD_WORLD` in `src/sim/hazards.ts`). No new damage or destruction system was written. |

### Compatibility Rules

- `nonSolid` + `friction !== 'default'` → **incompatible** (`nonSolidNoFriction`): non-solid blocks never collide, so friction has no effect.
- `fragile` + `collision !== 'solid'` → **incompatible** (`fragileRequiresSolid`): the breakable pathway replaces a solid wall; one-way/non-solid fragile blocks are not defined.
- `fragile` + footprint not 1×1 or 2×2 → **incompatible** (`fragileRequiresSupportedFootprint`): as of Phase 2B both 1×1 and 2×2 fragile footprints are supported (see "Phase 2B" below); any other footprint (not possible today — `tileWidth`/`tileHeight` are only ever 1 or 2 — kept for future-proofing) is rejected.
- At **load time** (untrusted/legacy JSON), an incompatible combination never crashes the campaign: `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties` forces the incompatible field back to its default (e.g. fragile + an unsupported footprint → `breakability: 'indestructible'`) and reports the fallback as a diagnostic.
- In the **editor**, incompatible combinations are never silently rewritten — Save is blocked and the exact rule violated is shown in the dialog's error line.

### Runtime Resolution and Caching

- `src/render/customBlockSpriteCache.ts`'s existing per-block cache (`registerCustomBlockSprite` / `invalidateCustomBlockSprite` / `getOrFallbackSprite`) now also stores the resolved `CustomBlockProperties` alongside each cached sprite canvas. One definition → one validated property profile, shared by every placement — no re-parsing or re-validation happens during rendering or collision building.
- `editorRoomBuilder.ts`'s `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` reads each custom block's properties from this cache (`getCustomBlockProperties`) when converting placements into `RoomWallDef`/`RoomBreakableBlockDef` entries. Saving an edited definition re-registers the cache entry; the next `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` call (and the next campaign export) picks up the new behavior for every existing placement automatically — no room JSON is rewritten.
- Renaming a block only changes its `name` field and does not call `invalidateCustomBlockSprite`, so neither its sprite canvas nor its cached properties are rebuilt (matches the existing rename/rebuild-avoidance behavior documented above).
- `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` (called on every campaign load/switch) clears cached properties along with cached sprites — two campaigns that happen to reuse the same local block ID can never see each other's property profile.
- Gameplay rendering (`customBlockGameplayRenderer.ts`) reads `sprite.properties.breakability` from the same cache entry (not JSON) to decide whether a placement is a fragile block; if so, it checks the sim's `world.isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` (matched by world position against `world.breakableBlockXWorld/YWorld`) and skips drawing the sprite once broken — the complete placement disappears, never a partial fragment.

### Editor Controls

`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts` gained a **Properties** section between the footprint selector and the pixel canvas:

- Three dropdowns (Collision, Friction, Breakability), each backed directly by the registry (`COLLISION_PRESET_REGISTRY`, etc.) so labels/descriptions can never drift from validation.
- A one-line description under each dropdown, e.g. "Can be passed from below and stood on from above." for One-way.
- A live compatibility line: if the current combination violates a rule, it is shown in orange and **Save is blocked** with the same message — never silently corrected.
- Property changes call `pushUndo()` before applying, so Undo/Redo restores both pixel data and properties together (the existing 50-entry bounded undo stack now snapshots `{ pixelData, properties }`).
- Property changes are included in the existing dirty-check (`isDirty()` now also compares `properties` against the saved snapshot), so Cancel/Escape with only a property change (no pixel edits) still triggers the Save & Close / Discard / Keep Editing prompt.
- Save always serializes via `serializeCustomBlock(..., properties)`, which always emits schemaVersion 2.
- The custom-block palette card (`editorUI.ts`) now shows a small text indicator per block, e.g. `One-way · Slippery · Fragile`, with a tooltip explaining it.

### Known Limitations (Phase 2A, superseded by Phase 2B below)

1. ~~2×2 fragile blocks are not supported.~~ **Resolved in Phase 2B** — see below.
2. **One-way platform edges 2/3 (left/right) are not exposed.** The underlying engine only fully implements top/bottom edges today (edges 2/3 are "reserved for future" in `movementAxisResolvers.ts`); the custom-block `oneWay` preset always uses the top edge, matching every other authored one-way wall in the game.
3. **Broken-fragile-block detection in the renderer is a position match, not an index handle.** `customBlockGameplayRenderer.ts` looks up `world.isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` by comparing world coordinates each frame. This avoids new per-placement bookkeeping but means two breakable entries that happen to share the exact same world position (not possible today) would be ambiguous — documented so no future system reuses this shortcut unchanged.
4. **No persistence of broken-fragile state across a full room reload.** This matches the existing built-in breakable-block behavior (`gameRoomHazards.ts` resets `isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` to 1 on room (re)load); custom fragile blocks (1×1 and 2×2 alike) intentionally behave identically rather than adding new persistence.

---

## Phase 2B: Multi-Cell Fragile Custom Blocks (2×2)

### Why 2×2 Fragile Was Previously Unsupported

`RoomDef.breakableBlocks` (`RoomBreakableBlockDef`) is inherently a **single-cell** mechanism: one entry = one `(xBlock, yBlock)` = one wall = one `world.isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` slot, destroyed independently by `src/sim/hazards.ts`. A naive 2×2 fragile block would need either (a) four independent single-cell entries — which could be struck and destroyed one quarter at a time, leaving 1–3 orphaned solid quarters and fragments — or (b) a brand-new multi-cell physics/destruction system, which Phase 2A explicitly declined to build. Phase 2A's `fragileRequires1x1` compatibility rule blocked 2×2+fragile at both the editor and the loader for exactly this reason.

### The Fix: Logical Placement Grouping, Not a New Engine

Phase 2B does **not** add a new destruction system. It adds one small, backward-compatible field — `groupId?: number` — to the existing `RoomBreakableBlockDef` (`src/levels/roomElementDefs.ts`) and threads it through the existing pipeline:

1. **Editor → RoomDef** (`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` in `src/editor/editorRoomBuilder.ts`): a 2×2 fragile custom block placement is expanded into **four** ordinary `RoomBreakableBlockDef` cells (one per occupied tile, exactly as if four separate 1×1 fragile blocks had been authored at those coordinates), and all four are tagged with the same `groupId` (a counter unique within the room). A 1×1 fragile placement still produces exactly one cell with `groupId` omitted (`undefined`), byte-identical to pre-Phase-2B behavior.
2. **Room load** (`loadRoomHazards` in `src/screens/gameRoomHazards.ts`): copies `b.groupId ?? -1` into a new parallel array, `world.breakableBlockGroupId: Int16Array` (`src/sim/worldHazardState.ts`). `-1` means "ungrouped" (every pre-Phase-2B breakable block, and every 1×1 custom fragile block).
3. **Destruction** (`applyHazards` in `src/sim/hazards.ts`): when the momentum-threshold check breaks cell `i` (via the new shared `destroyBreakableBlockCell(world, index)` helper, which deactivates the flag and zeroes the matching wall's `wWorld`/`hWorld` — the single place that mutates breakable/wall state), it then checks `world.breakableBlockGroupId[i]`. If it is `>= 0`, the loop scans every **other** cell sharing that group id and destroys any that are still active, in the same pass. This is the atomic transaction: whichever of the 4 cells is struck, all 4 become inactive and lose their collision within the same tick, with no intermediate partial state observable between them.

### The 9-Step Transaction, Mapped to Code

| Spec step | Implementation |
|---|---|
| 1. Resolve struck cell → placement | The struck cell's `world.breakableBlockGroupId[i]` *is* the placement identity — no separate lookup table needed. |
| 2. Verify not already processed | The per-cell `isBreakableBlockActiveFlag[i] === 0` guard at the top of the hazard loop and inside the group-destroy inner loop — re-striking an already-broken cell (or its already-broken groupmates) is a no-op. |
| 3. Gather the exact 4 occupied tiles | Done once, at room-build time, in `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` — the 4 cells pushed for one placement are exactly its footprint, from authoritative `EditorCustomBlockPlacement` data (`xBlock/yBlock/tileWidth/tileHeight`), never inferred by scanning neighboring tiles for a matching block ID. |
| 4. Remove collision for all 4 | `destroyBreakableBlockCell` zeroes `wallWWorld`/`wallHWorld` for each cell's own wall index. |
| 5. Remove render/placement state for all 4 | `customBlockGameplayRenderer.ts` checks the **anchor** cell's breakable entry (one of the 4, since the anchor tile is always cell `(dx=0, dy=0)` of the group) via `isFragilePlacementBroken`; because the group destroys atomically, the anchor's flag flips to inactive in the same tick as the other 3, so the whole sprite disappears in one frame — never a partial quarter. |
| 6. Update runtime room state | All mutation is on the sim `WorldState` (`isBreakableBlockActiveFlag`, `wallWWorld/HWorld`) — no authored room JSON or custom block definition is ever touched. |
| 7. Trigger break effects in a controlled way | The engine has no per-cell particle/sound effect for breakable blocks today (only the cracked-brick fill in `src/render/hazards.ts`, gated by the same active-flag, so it already stops drawing all 4 cells together — no fan-out to suppress). |
| 8. Mark dirty | The sim's existing per-tick wall/flag mutation is what the renderer already reads every frame — no additional dirty flag needed (matches how single-cell fragile blocks already work). |
| 9. Prevent duplicate destruction same frame | The active-flag guard makes every step idempotent: calling `applyHazards` (or hitting the same/groupmate cell) again in the same tick is a safe no-op. Covered by an automated test (see below). |

### Backward Compatibility

- `groupId` is optional on `RoomBreakableBlockDef` and defaults to `-1` in `world.breakableBlockGroupId` when absent — pre-Phase-2B room JSON (with no `groupId` field on any breakable-block entry) loads and behaves identically to before.
- No schema version bump: `CUSTOM_BLOCK_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays `2`. Nothing changed in the on-disk custom block **definition** format (`CustomBlockSourceDefV2`) — 2×2 fragile is purely a property-compatibility and room-building change, not a serialization change.
- 1×1 fragile custom blocks are completely unaffected: `isEligibleForBreakablePathway` still routes them to a single ungrouped cell, and `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` still pushes exactly one `RoomBreakableBlockDef` with no `groupId`.

### Editor Changes

- `checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility`'s `fragileRequiresSupportedFootprint` rule now accepts both 1×1 and 2×2 (previously `fragileRequires1x1` rejected anything but 1×1). `nonSolid + fragile` and `fragile` with `oneWay` collision remain blocked via the unchanged `fragileRequiresSolid` rule.
- The editor's live compatibility line (`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts`) and Save-blocking behavior are unchanged in mechanism — they simply now report zero issues for a 2×2 solid+fragile combination instead of one.
- Property changes (including flipping a definition between fragile and indestructible) continue to participate in dirty tracking, undo/redo (`{ pixelData, properties }` snapshots), Save/Discard/Cancel, duplicate, rename, and export exactly as in Phase 2A — none of that machinery is footprint-aware, so it needed no changes for 2×2.

### Runtime Property Hardening Findings (Audit)

- **Collision**: `resolveWallBehavior` is unchanged and correctly covers the complete `wBlock × hBlock` footprint for `solid`/`oneWay`; `nonSolid` generates no wall. Switching a placement's definition from `solid` to `nonSolid` (or vice versa) takes effect the next time `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` runs (e.g. next export or resident-room rebuild) with no room-data rewrite, since the wall array is rebuilt from the cache-resolved properties every time.
- **Friction**: a 2×2 placement produces one `RoomWallDef` (for solid/oneWay, non-fragile) or four grouped breakable cells (fragile) — in both cases there is exactly one property profile per placement (read once from the sprite cache), so there is no way for "multiple occupancy cells" to disagree; there is only ever one wall (or one group) per placement. `nonSolid` blocks never generate a wall, so friction can never apply to them (enforced by `nonSolidNoFriction`).
- **Friction hardening bug found and fixed**: prior to Phase 2B, `gameRoomHazards.ts` built the breakable-pathway wall for *every* breakable block (built-in or fragile custom, 1×1 or would-be 2×2) with a hardcoded default wall theme and never set `wallIsIceFlag`, so a `fragile` + `slippery` custom block silently lost its ice friction the moment it was routed to the breakable pathway — the `resolveWallBehavior().blockTheme === 'ice'` result was computed but discarded. Fixed by adding an optional `blockTheme?: 'blackRock' | 'ice'` field to `RoomBreakableBlockDef` (`src/levels/roomElementDefs.ts`), populated by `editorRoomBuilder.ts` only when the resolved theme is `'ice'` (left `undefined` for the default case, preserving the exact pre-existing `WALL_THEME_DEFAULT_INDEX` sentinel rather than forcing a concrete "blackRock" index), and consumed by `loadRoomHazards` in `gameRoomHazards.ts` to set both `wallThemeIndex` and `wallIsIceFlag` correctly on the breakable cell's wall. This applies to both 1×1 and 2×2 fragile+slippery blocks alike.
- **Breakability**: `indestructible` blocks are never passed to `isEligibleForBreakablePathway` (it requires `breakability === 'fragile'`), so they can never enter the breakable/group-destroy path. Missing/unregistered block IDs fall back to `DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES` (`collision: solid, breakability: indestructible`) via `getCustomBlockProperties`, so an unresolvable placement still renders its full solid footprint rather than silently vanishing or half-colliding.
- **Campaign switching**: `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` clears the property cache; `world.breakableBlockGroupId` (like all hazard arrays) is fully repopulated by `loadRoomHazards` on every room (re)load, so no group id or destruction state can leak between rooms or campaigns.

### Effect Emission Policy

One logical placement → at most one visible disappearance event, never four. Concretely: the engine's only current "effect" for a breaking block is that the cracked-brick overlay (`src/render/hazards.ts`) and the custom sprite (`customBlockGameplayRenderer.ts`) stop being drawn once `isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` is 0; since the group-destroy loop flips all 4 flags in the same tick, all 4 quarters (and the whole custom sprite) disappear in the same frame. There is no per-cell particle/sound system to fan out ×4 in the first place — if a future phase adds one (see below), it must gate on "is this the group's first cell processed this pass" (the outer loop index `i`) to preserve this one-emission-per-placement policy.

### Persistence / Reset Semantics

Identical to built-in single-cell breakable blocks: `isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` (and now `breakableBlockGroupId`) live only in the transient sim `WorldState`, rebuilt from `RoomDef.breakableBlocks` every time `loadRoomHazards` runs. Leaving and re-entering a room, or reloading the campaign, respawns every fragile custom block (1×1 and 2×2 alike) — there is no persistent "broken" flag written back into room JSON or campaign save state. This matches the explicit constraint against inventing new persistent campaign mutation for custom blocks.

### Tests (Phase 2B)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2B.test.ts` (24 tests, grouped into 5 `describe` blocks), plus 2 updated assertions in `src/tests/customBlockProperties.test.ts` (the `fragileRequires1x1`/"2x2 fragile is flagged incompatible" test and the `isEligibleForBreakablePathway` 2×2 test, both flipped from "rejected" to "accepted" since that is the exact limitation this phase removes — no other Phase 2A test was touched):

1. **Compatibility rule relaxation** (tests 1–8): solid 2×2 fragile now has zero compatibility issues; solid 1×1 fragile unchanged; `nonSolid`/`oneWay` + fragile still blocked by `fragileRequiresSolid` regardless of footprint; `nonSolidNoFriction` still fires independent of footprint; `isEligibleForBreakablePathway` returns `true` for 2×2 solid+fragile; `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties` no longer falls back 2×2 solid+fragile to indestructible, but still does for non-solid 2×2 fragile.
2. **`editorRoomBuilder` grouping** (tests 9–14, real `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` calls, not mocks): 1×1 fragile still yields exactly one ungrouped cell; 2×2 fragile yields exactly 4 cells at the correct 4 coordinates sharing one group id with no plain wall generated; two touching 2×2 placements of the *same* definition get two distinct group ids; fragile+slippery threads `blockTheme: 'ice'` onto the breakable cell while fragile+default leaves it `undefined`; a placement referencing an unregistered/missing block ID falls back to one full-footprint solid wall, not a breakable entry.
3. **Atomic destruction transaction** (tests 15–20, real `createWorldState` + `loadRoomHazards` + `applyHazards`): 1×1 fragile destruction is unchanged; striking **any** of the 4 cells (parametrized over all 4 offsets) destroys all 4 atomically; destruction zeroes collision (`wallWWorld`/`wallHWorld`) for all 4 corresponding walls; two adjacent same-definition 2×2 placements remain independently destructible (striking one leaves the other's 4 cells untouched); calling `applyHazards` multiple times in the same tick after destruction is idempotent (`assert.doesNotThrow`, flags stay at 0); a player below the momentum threshold does not break any cell.
4. **Renderer suppression** (test 21): a broken 2×2 placement (anchor cell inactive) is not drawn at all, exercising the real `renderCustomBlockSprites`.
5. **Backward compatibility** (tests 22–24): a hand-built `RoomBreakableBlockDef` with no `groupId`/`blockTheme` fields at all loads via `loadRoomHazards` without throwing, resolves to group `-1`, and still breaks correctly under `applyHazards`; clearing the sprite cache (simulated campaign switch) and re-registering the same block ID under different properties fully replaces the old entry with no leakage; a spot-check that base Phase 2A compatibility rules (solid/oneWay/nonSolid, `nonSolidNoFriction`) still hold.

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (821/821 passing, 0 pre-existing failures, 2 Phase 2A tests updated to reflect the now-intended 2×2-fragile-is-compatible behavior), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase, and all passed.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running game or editor session (no live browser/editor click-through of creating a 2×2 fragile block, placing it, running into it from each of the 4 sides in the real renderer, saving/reloading a real campaign file, or exercising undo/redo/copy-paste/duplicate/delete through the actual editor UI). All verification of gameplay behavior (atomic destruction, collision removal, renderer suppression, friction theming, backward compatibility) was done through the automated test suite described above (`src/tests/customBlocksPhase2B.test.ts`), which exercises the real `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`, `loadRoomHazards`, `applyHazards`, and `renderCustomBlockSprites` code paths (not mocks of them) but does not drive an actual UI or rendered frame.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually place a 2×2 fragile block in the editor, save, reload, and break it in-game from each side before shipping, since that end-to-end path has not been clicked through by a human or an automated UI driver.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **No true persistence of broken state across room reload** (by design — matches built-in behavior; see above).
2. **Group ids are per-room and stored in an `Int16Array`** — in practice bounded by `MAX_BREAKABLE_BLOCKS` (32 total breakable-block cells per room today, in `src/sim/worldHazardState.ts`), which is the real ceiling on how many 2×2 fragile blocks (8 cells each including a same-room neighbor) plus 1×1 fragile/built-in breakable blocks can coexist in one room, not the much larger Int16 range.
3. **No dedicated break particle/sound effect exists yet for breakable blocks of any kind** (built-in or custom) — Phase 2B preserves whatever the engine already does (nothing beyond the visual disappearance) rather than inventing one.
4. **Renderer broken-detection is still a position match** (limitation #3 above, inherited from Phase 2A) — now also relied upon for 2×2 anchor-cell lookup; still safe because anchor-cell coordinates are unique per placement.

## Phase 2C: Material-Response Presets and Break Feedback

Phase 2C adds the first real break sound and break particle effect for the
breakable-block system (built-in and custom alike), gated by a new
engine-defined `materialResponse` property. Resolves "Remaining Limitations"
#3 from Phase 2B ("No dedicated break particle/sound effect exists yet").

### Final Property Shape and Default

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "collision": "solid",
    "friction": "default",
    "breakability": "fragile",
    "materialResponse": "stone"
  }
}
```

`materialResponse` is a strict enum — `'stone' | 'wood' | 'metal'` — added to
`CustomBlockProperties` (`src/levels/customBlockProperties.ts`) alongside
`collision`/`friction`/`breakability`. No schema version bump:
`CUSTOM_BLOCK_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays `2`. Defaults to `'stone'`:

- Schema-v1 blocks (no `properties` object at all).
- Schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2C (`properties` present, `materialResponse` absent).
- Unregistered/missing custom block definitions (`DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES`).
- Built-in (non-custom-block) breakable blocks authored directly in a room, which have no `materialResponse` field on `RoomBreakableBlockDef` at all.

Unknown values (e.g. `"materialResponse": "diamond"`) never crash — they
produce a structured `CustomBlockValidationError` (`field:
'properties.materialResponse'`) via `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties`
and fall back to `'stone'`, exactly mirroring how an unknown `collision` or
`breakability` value is handled. Saving through the editor always writes the
resolved value explicitly (via `serializeCustomBlock`), never omits it.

Room placements are unaffected: a room only ever references a custom block by
its stable ID (`"custom:<id>"`); `materialResponse` lives entirely in the
block **definition**, resolved once and cached, never duplicated per
placement in room JSON.

### Material Registry Design

`MATERIAL_RESPONSE_PRESET_REGISTRY` (`src/levels/customBlockProperties.ts`) is
the single authoritative source of labels/descriptions, following the exact
`PresetMeta<T>` shape already used by `COLLISION_PRESET_REGISTRY` /
`FRICTION_PRESET_REGISTRY` / `BREAKABILITY_PRESET_REGISTRY`:

| Preset | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `stone` | Stone | Heavy stone-like break sound and rocky debris. |
| `wood` | Wood | Lighter wooden crack and splinter-like debris. |
| `metal` | Metal | Metallic impact and spark-like debris. |

Two small numeric-packing helpers, `materialResponseToIndex` /
`indexToMaterialResponse`, map the enum to/from a `0|1|2` index for
`Uint8Array` storage in `WorldState` (`world.breakableBlockMaterial`,
`world.breakEventMaterial`) — the same pattern `blockThemeToIndex` already
uses for wall themes. Unknown indices decode back to `'stone'`.

`materialResponse` is selectable on **indestructible** blocks too (no
compatibility rule blocks it) so it is already resolved and cached for a
future impact-feedback phase — but in Phase 2C no break event is ever emitted
for a block that never enters the breakable pathway in the first place
(`isEligibleForBreakablePathway` still requires `breakability === 'fragile'`
+ solid collision + a 1×1/2×2 footprint, unchanged from Phase 2B).

### Editor Integration

- A **Material response** dropdown was added to the custom-block dialog's
  existing Properties section (`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts`), built with the
  same generic `makePropertyRow` helper the other three properties use — no
  new UI plumbing.
- `propertiesEqual` (drives dirty-state detection) now also compares
  `materialResponse`, so a materialResponse-only change is correctly flagged
  dirty and triggers the existing Save/Discard/Keep-Editing prompt on cancel.
- Undo/redo is unaffected structurally: each undo/redo stack entry is already
  `{ pixelData, properties }` — since `materialResponse` lives inside
  `properties`, it is captured and restored for free.
- Rename (`onRenameCustomBlock`) and Duplicate (`onDuplicateCustomBlock`) in
  `editorController.ts` both pass `def.properties` straight through
  `serializeCustomBlock`, so `materialResponse` is preserved by rename and
  copied (with a newly generated stable ID) by duplicate with zero
  materialResponse-specific code.
- The palette card badge (`editorUI.ts`) now appends ` · Stone` / ` · Wood` /
  ` · Metal` alongside the existing collision/friction/breakability badges.

### Runtime Profile and the Sprite-Rebuild Optimization

`materialResponse` is resolved and validated exactly once, in the same place
as the other three properties — inside `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties`,
called from `parseCustomBlockSource` at block-registration time
(campaign load, block create, block edit). The simulation loop never parses
or re-validates properties; `src/sim/hazards.ts` only ever reads a packed
`Uint8Array` index that was resolved ahead of time by `gameRoomHazards.ts` at
room-load time.

A materialResponse-only edit does not rebuild the pixel sprite: previously
*any* saved edit (pixel or property) called `invalidateCustomBlockSprite`,
which deletes and rebuilds the cached `OffscreenCanvas`/`HTMLCanvasElement`
and re-uploads pixel data, even if only a dropdown changed. Phase 2C adds
`updateCustomBlockProperties(rawId, properties)` to
`customBlockSpriteCache.ts`, which replaces only the cached `properties`
field on the existing sprite entry, leaving the canvas object untouched.
`editorController.ts`'s `onEditCustomBlock` now byte-compares the saved
pixel data against the previous definition's pixel data; if unchanged, it
calls `updateCustomBlockProperties` instead of
`invalidateCustomBlockSprite`/`registerCustomBlockSprite` (falling back to a
full rebuild if the block was not already cached, so a properties-only save
of an uncached block still ends up registered). Renaming already skipped
sprite invalidation entirely before Phase 2C (unchanged) — it still does.

Campaign switching clears material profiles exactly as it already cleared
collision/friction/breakability: `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` empties the
whole property cache, and every hazard array (including the new
`world.breakableBlockMaterial`) is fully repopulated by `loadRoomHazards` on
the next room load — no cross-campaign leakage is possible.

### Break-Event Architecture

Rather than triggering sound and particles directly from every destroyed
breakable-block cell (which would fan out ×4 for a 2×2 group), Phase 2C adds
one small, engine-owned, one-tick break-event queue to `WorldState`
(`src/sim/worldHazardState.ts`):

```
breakEventCount:         number         // reset to 0 at the top of every applyHazards() call
breakEventXWorld/YWorld: Float32Array   // full-footprint center (world units)
breakEventWWorld/HWorld: Float32Array   // full-footprint size (world units)
breakEventMaterial:      Uint8Array     // packed materialResponse index
breakEventGroupId:       Int16Array     // -1 if ungrouped
breakEventIsGroupedFlag: Uint8Array     // 1 if a multi-cell (2x2) placement
```

Bounded by `MAX_BREAK_EVENTS = 8` — generous for anything a single
player-sized AABB could plausibly overlap in one tick; overflow events are
silently dropped since they are purely cosmetic and never affect collision or
destruction state.

`applyHazards` (`src/sim/hazards.ts`) is the **only** writer, via a small
`emitBreakEvent(...)` helper called at exactly the point where a cell's
destruction transaction begins — reusing the already-established atomic
group-destroy transaction from Phase 2B, not a new one:

- **1×1 (ungrouped)**: one event, centered on the cell, footprint =
  `BLOCK_SIZE_MEDIUM × BLOCK_SIZE_MEDIUM`.
- **2×2 (grouped)**: the struck cell scans every cell sharing its `groupId`
  (all of which are guaranteed still active — the group is atomic, so it is
  either fully intact or fully destroyed) to compute the union AABB *before*
  any cell is deactivated, emits **one** event covering the complete
  placement, and only then proceeds to destroy all 4 cells. The struck cell
  is the one that "owns" the emission — matching the requirement that the
  cell which first initiates group destruction owns the one effect.

The consuming side (`src/screens/gameBreakEvents.ts`, called once per
physics tick from the same fixed-step accumulator loop that already drives
`tickCrumbleDebrisEvents`) drains the queue: for each event it converts the
packed material index back to `'stone'|'wood'|'metal'`, spawns particles via
`BreakEffectRenderer.notifyBreak`, and plays the mapped sound via
`PlayerSfxManager.play`. This pathway is not exposed to campaign-authored
code in any way — it is pure `WorldState` → render-layer plumbing.

**Duplicate/re-entrant safety**: the outer per-cell
`isBreakableBlockActiveFlag[i] === 0` guard (unchanged from Phase 2B) means a
cell already destroyed this tick or a previous tick can never re-enter the
branch that calls `emitBreakEvent`, so repeated `applyHazards` calls on an
already-broken placement emit zero additional events. **Adjacent-placement
independence**: events are scoped to one `groupId` at a time, so breaking one
2×2 placement never touches — and never emits an event for — an adjacent
placement, grouped or not.

### Sound Mapping

`src/audio/breakSfx.ts` is a pure, DOM-free, audio-hardware-free selection
boundary — the "testable sound-event selection boundary" alternative to
mocking browser audio globals. It maps each material to an **existing**
`PlayerSfxManager` sound name (no new sound assets were added):

| Material | Reused sound | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `stone` | `jump_impact_hard` | Heaviest existing impact — reads as a rock/masonry thud. |
| `wood` | `jump_impact_medium` | A lighter impact than stone — reads as a duller wooden crack. |
| `metal` | `grapple_impact` | The grapple hook's metal-on-surface clink is the closest existing metallic sound in the project. |

All three presets resolve to **distinct** existing assets (no two materials
collapse onto the same sound). `resolveBreakVolumeScale(isGrouped,
concurrentEventCount)` gives grouped (2×2) breaks a modestly higher base
volume than a lone 1×1 cell, and attenuates by `1/√n` (floored at 0.5×) when
multiple break events fire in the same tick, so a pile-up of simultaneous
breaks does not clip or sum into an overloud burst. Sound is played through
the existing `PlayerSfxManager`, so it automatically honors the existing SFX
volume/mute setting (`getSfxVolume()`) and requires no `AudioContext` in
tests — `materialBreakSoundName`/`resolveBreakVolumeScale` are pure functions
tested directly.

### Particle Mapping

`src/render/breakEffectRenderer.ts`'s `BreakEffectRenderer` mirrors the
existing `CrumbleDebrisRenderer` pattern exactly: bounded typed-array pools
(`MAX_DEBRIS = 100`), its own module-local deterministic LCG (never
`Math.random`, never serialized, never read by the simulation), gravity +
gentle gray/tan/spark-colored fade-out. Each material gets a distinct,
bounded, engine-owned profile (`getMaterialParticleProfile`):

| Material | Colors | Feel | Base count (1×1) | Grouped count (2×2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stone` | gray/brown | compact rocky debris, moderate speed/gravity | 10 | 16 |
| `wood` | tan/brown | small splinter-like debris, slightly lighter gravity | 9 | 14 |
| `metal` | yellow/white/gray | brief fast sparks, low gravity, short lifetime | 8 | 13 |

Grouped (2×2) placements scale up modestly (≈1.6×), never 4× — a pile of 4
cells' worth of destruction reads as "one bigger event," not four
independent bursts layered on top of each other. `resolveBreakParticleCount`
is a pure function (material, isGrouped, quality) → count, directly
unit-tested without a canvas or renderer instance.

Effects are purely cosmetic: `notifyBreak`/`update`/`render` never touch
`WorldState`, collision, damage, movement, or room persistence.

### Low-Graphics Behavior

`resolveBreakParticleCount` scales the base/grouped count by the active
`GraphicsQuality` tier (`getGraphicsQuality()`, `'low'|'med'|'high'`):
`low` → ×0.4, `med` → ×1.0 (baseline), `high` → ×1.3. This visibly reduces
(never increases beyond a modest bump) cosmetic particle output on `low`
while leaving sound behavior unaffected (sound is not part of "reduced
particles"). Sound already respects the game's existing volume/mute
settings via `PlayerSfxManager`.

### 1×1 and 2×2 Effect Behavior Summary

| | 1×1 fragile | 2×2 fragile |
|---|---|---|
| Break events emitted | 1 | 1 (never 4) |
| Event center | cell center | union-footprint center of all 4 cells |
| Event footprint | 1 block × 1 block | 2 blocks × 2 blocks |
| Sound plays | once | once |
| Particle burst | `baseCount` | `groupedCount` (≈1.6×, not 4×) |
| Adjacent placements | independent | independent (scoped by `groupId`) |

### Backward Compatibility

- Schema-v1 blocks, and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2C, load exactly
  as before and resolve `materialResponse` to `'stone'` with zero validation
  errors (absence is not an error — only an explicit unknown value is).
- All existing stable IDs, room references, 1×1/2×2 fragile behavior,
  indestructible/non-solid/one-way/slippery behavior, and built-in breakable
  blocks are unchanged in every respect except that breaking now produces
  sound + particles where previously nothing happened.
- The break momentum threshold (`BREAKABLE_MOMENTUM_THRESHOLD_WORLD`) and the
  absence of resistance tiers are both unchanged, per this phase's scope.
- Room reload semantics are unchanged: broken blocks (and their break-event
  cosmetic history, which is transient and per-tick anyway) respawn on
  reload, exactly matching Phase 2B.
- Export and campaign relocation preserve `materialResponse` through the
  ordinary `serializeCustomBlock` → `parseCustomBlockSource` round trip — no
  special-cased persistence was added.

### Tests (Phase 2C)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2C.test.ts` (27 tests) exercises the
real pipeline (`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` → `loadRoomHazards` → `applyHazards`)
wherever practical, not just registry helpers — schema-v1/v2 defaults, all
three presets round-tripping through `serializeCustomBlock`/
`parseCustomBlockSource`, unknown-value fallback with a structured
diagnostic, dirty-tracking/undo-redo/rename/duplicate at the data-model level
(the pixel-art dialog itself is DOM-driven and, consistent with the rest of
this suite, is not exercised via a browser DOM stub), the real break-event
queue for 1×1 and all four struck-cell offsets of a 2×2 group, exact
union-footprint center/size assertions, duplicate-destruction and
adjacent-placement independence, distinct sound/particle profile selection,
bounded and quality-scaled particle counts, indestructible blocks emitting no
event, missing-definition fallback, export/relocation round trip, and
campaign-switch isolation. Two pre-existing Phase 2A round-trip-equality
assertions in `customBlockProperties.test.ts` (tests 2 and 17) were updated
to include `materialResponse: 'stone'` in their expected literal, since the
resolved property bundle now legitimately has one more field — no other
Phase 2A/2B test was touched, and all 848 tests in the suite pass.

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (848/848
  passing), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running
  game or editor session — no live browser/editor click-through of creating
  stone/wood/metal 1×1 and 2×2 fragile blocks, breaking them and listening
  for distinct sounds, confirming one burst per logical placement, confirming
  adjacent-block independence, or confirming low-graphics behavior visually.
  All verification was done through the automated test suite exercising the
  real `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`, `loadRoomHazards`, and `applyHazards` code
  paths (not mocks), plus direct unit tests of the pure sound/particle
  selection functions — but no actual audio was heard and no actual frame was
  rendered by a human or automated UI driver.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually create a
  stone, wood, and metal fragile block (both 1×1 and 2×2), place and break
  each in-game, and confirm the sound/particle feel before shipping.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **No dedicated new sound or particle assets** — all three materials reuse
   existing `PlayerSfxManager` sounds and a generic colored-rectangle debris
   particle; a future phase could commission material-specific assets.
2. **Metal's sound is a reasonable existing-asset proxy, not a purpose-built
   metallic clang** — `grapple_impact` was the closest fit available.
3. **`materialResponse` on indestructible blocks is inert in Phase 2C** — it
   is resolved and cached for a future impact-feedback phase but no event
   fires for a block that is never destroyed.
4. **Break events are transient, one-tick state** — like all Phase 2B
   destruction state, nothing about a break event persists across a room
   reload (matches existing behavior; not a regression).
5. **`MAX_BREAK_EVENTS = 8`** is a hard per-tick ceiling; astronomically
   unlikely to be hit by a single player-sized AABB, but overflow events are
   silently dropped rather than queued.

## Phase 2D: Contact-Damage Presets

Phase 2D adds an engine-defined `contactDamage` property so a solid custom
block can damage the player on contact, reusing the existing hazard damage
pathway verbatim rather than building a second health/damage system.

### The New Property and Defaults

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "collision": "solid",
    "friction": "default",
    "breakability": "indestructible",
    "materialResponse": "metal",
    "contactDamage": "low"
  }
}
```

`contactDamage` is a strict enum — `'none' | 'low' | 'high'` — added to
`CustomBlockProperties` (`src/levels/customBlockProperties.ts`) alongside the
three Phase 2A properties and Phase 2C's `materialResponse`. No schema
version bump: `CUSTOM_BLOCK_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays `2`. Defaults to `'none'`:

- Schema-v1 blocks (no `properties` object at all).
- Schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2D (`properties` present, `contactDamage` absent).
- Unregistered/missing custom block definitions (`DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES`).
- Built-in (non-custom-block) breakable/solid blocks, which have no
  `contactDamage` concept at all and are entirely unaffected — `none` is not
  something authors ever see for them, it is simply the absence of the new
  `RoomDef.contactDamageBlocks` mechanism.

Unknown values (e.g. `"contactDamage": "extreme"`) never crash — they produce
a structured `CustomBlockValidationError` (`field: 'properties.contactDamage'`)
via `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties` and fall back to `'none'`,
exactly mirroring how an unknown `materialResponse` or `breakability` value
is handled. Saving through the editor always writes the resolved value
explicitly. Room placements are unaffected: a room only ever references a
custom block by its stable ID; `contactDamage` lives entirely in the block
**definition**.

### Registry and Compatibility Rules

`CONTACT_DAMAGE_PRESET_REGISTRY` follows the exact `PresetMeta<T>` shape every
other preset registry uses:

| Preset | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | None | Does not damage the player. |
| `low` | Low | Applies the engine's lower contact-damage preset. |
| `high` | High | Applies the engine's stronger contact-damage preset. |

`contactDamageTierToIndex` / `indexToContactDamageTier` pack the two
*damaging* tiers (`'none'` is never stored — see Runtime Representation
below) into a `0|1` index for `Uint8Array` storage, the same pattern
`materialResponseToIndex` established in Phase 2C.

**Compatibility rule — `contactDamageRequiresSolid`**: `contactDamage !==
'none'` combined with `collision !== 'solid'` (i.e. `oneWay` or `nonSolid`)
is rejected, added to `checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility` alongside the
existing `fragileRequiresSolid`/`nonSolidNoFriction`/
`fragileRequiresSupportedFootprint` rules. This keeps Phase 2D entirely on
the existing solid-contact collision pathway rather than adding a new
trigger-volume system for one-way/non-solid blocks. At **save time** the
editor blocks saving and shows the exact issue message (the dialog's
existing `checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility`-gated Save button needed no
changes — the new rule flows through the same mechanism). At **load time**
(untrusted/legacy JSON), the combination never crashes: `contactDamage`
safely falls back to `'none'` while `collision` itself is left untouched, and
a diagnostic is recorded.

Both fragile and indestructible solid blocks may use contact damage — there
is no rule linking `contactDamage` to `breakability` (see "Interaction with
Fragile Blocks" below for how the two combine at runtime).

### Editor Integration

- A **Contact damage** dropdown was added to the custom-block dialog's
  Properties section (`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts`), built with the same
  generic `makePropertyRow` helper every other property uses.
- `propertiesEqual` (drives dirty-state detection) now also compares
  `contactDamage`, so a contactDamage-only change is correctly flagged dirty.
- Undo/redo needed no new plumbing: each snapshot is already the full
  `{ pixelData, properties }` object, so `contactDamage` is captured/restored
  for free.
- Rename and Duplicate both pass `def.properties` straight through
  `serializeCustomBlock`, so `contactDamage` is preserved by rename and
  copied (with a newly generated stable ID) by duplicate with zero
  contactDamage-specific code.
- The palette card badge (`editorUI.ts`) now appends ` · Dmg:Low` /
  ` · Dmg:High` (nothing for `none`) alongside the existing badges.
- Invalid combinations (`oneWay`/`nonSolid` + damage) show the exact
  `contactDamageRequiresSolid` message via the dialog's existing
  `refreshCompatibilityMessage`/Save-blocking mechanism — no new UI code.
- No raw damage, knockback, cooldown, or invulnerability number is ever
  exposed in the UI — only the three-value enum dropdown.

### Runtime Representation

`contactDamage` is resolved and validated exactly once, in the same place as
every other property — inside `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties`,
called from `parseCustomBlockSource` at block-registration time (campaign
load, block create, block edit). The simulation loop never parses or
re-validates properties; `src/sim/hazards.ts` only ever reads a packed
`Uint8Array` tier index resolved ahead of time by `gameRoomHazards.ts` at
room-load time.

A contactDamage-only edit does not rebuild the pixel sprite: it reuses the
exact `updateCustomBlockProperties` fast path Phase 2C introduced for
materialResponse-only edits — `editorController.ts`'s `onEditCustomBlock`
byte-compares saved pixel data against the previous definition and, if
unchanged, updates only the cached `properties` field, leaving the
`OffscreenCanvas`/`HTMLCanvasElement` untouched. Renaming already skipped
sprite invalidation before Phase 2C/2D — unchanged.

Campaign switching clears damage profiles exactly as it already cleared the
other three properties: `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` empties the whole
property cache, and `world.contactDamageBlockCount`/arrays are fully
repopulated by `loadRoomHazards` on the next room load — no cross-campaign
leakage is possible. Missing/unregistered definitions fall back to
`DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES.contactDamage = 'none'` via
`getCustomBlockProperties`.

Because `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` re-resolves each placement's properties
fresh from the sprite cache every time it runs (on export, on resident-room
rebuild, on reopening a room), changing a block definition's `contactDamage`
tier and re-running that conversion automatically updates every placement of
that block — no placement coordinates are rewritten, and no per-placement
cache invalidation is needed.

### Contact-Detection Architecture

Contact damage is **not** derived from a per-frame scan of custom block
placements, and it does not hook into the physics wall-collision resolver
(which does not retain a "which walls were touched this tick" list to begin
with — see the Phase 2D investigation notes below). Instead it follows the
exact same shape every other hazard in `src/sim/hazards.ts` already uses:
`RoomDef.contactDamageBlocks` (`RoomContactDamageBlockDef[]`) is a small,
room-scoped, pre-resolved array — built once by `editorRoomBuilder.ts` from
solid custom-block placements with `contactDamage !== 'none'`
(`isEligibleForContactDamage`), independent of whether the placement is also
fragile — and loaded into bounded `WorldState` arrays
(`MAX_CONTACT_DAMAGE_BLOCKS = 32`) by `gameRoomHazards.ts`. `applyHazards`
then does a plain AABB-overlap check against this small array, exactly like
the existing spike/lava-zone loops: no momentum requirement, no wall-index
lookup, no dependency on sprite pixel data (see "Transparent Pixels" below).

**Investigation findings** (`src/sim/clusters/movementAxisResolvers.ts`,
`movementCollision.ts`): the collision resolver iterates the wall array and
resolves position/velocity per wall every tick, but only records two
booleans (`isTouchingWallLeftFlag`/`isTouchingWallRightFlag`, used for wall
jumps) — it does not retain "which wall index was touched this tick"
anywhere. Reusing that layer directly was not viable without adding new
resolver-side bookkeeping, which risks touching the collision engine itself
(explicitly out of scope). The bounded-array-plus-AABB-check pattern already
used by every other hazard type *is* "the existing collision info" pathway
in this codebase's architecture — it avoids scanning custom block placements
or the full wall array, scanning only the small, pre-resolved
`contactDamageBlockCount` (≤ 32) array instead.

**Damage and knockback mapping** — reuses `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback`
(`src/sim/playerDamage.ts`) verbatim, the same function every hazard in the
game already calls:

| Tier | Damage points | Existing constant matched | Knockback | Invulnerability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | — | — (no array entry created at all) | — | — |
| `low` | 1 | `LAVA_ZONE_DAMAGE` | `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback`'s existing linear formula (`MIN_DAMAGE_KNOCKBACK_SPEED_WORLD + damage × DAMAGE_KNOCKBACK_SPEED_PER_DAMAGE_WORLD`) | `INVULNERABILITY_DURATION_TICKS` (90 ticks), same as every hazard |
| `high` | 2 | `SPIKE_DAMAGE` | Same formula, proportionally stronger from the higher damage input | Same 90-tick window |

`CUSTOM_BLOCK_CONTACT_DAMAGE_LOW = 1` / `CUSTOM_BLOCK_CONTACT_DAMAGE_HIGH = 2`
(`src/sim/hazards.ts`) are new named constants, but their *values* are not
new — they match the dominant 1/2 damage scale already used by
`LAVA_ZONE_DAMAGE`, `SPIKE_DAMAGE`, and the large majority of enemy
contact-damage constants across `src/sim/clusters/*Config.ts` (surveyed
before choosing these values). No separate knockback or invulnerability
constant was introduced — both come free from `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback`
simply being called with a damage amount of 1 or 2, identical to how spikes
and lava already produce their own knockback/invulnerability behavior.

**Knockback direction** follows the contacted surface: the source point
passed to `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback` is the nearest point on the
block's (or, for a grouped placement, the full union) AABB to the player
center — the exact same nearest-point-on-AABB pattern the existing lava-zone
code already uses. This means knockback is never a fixed one-way push; it
reflects whichever side of the block the player is actually touching.

### Logical Placement Ownership and 2×2 Deduplication

`RoomContactDamageBlockDef.groupId` is a new, independent id space
(`src/levels/roomElementDefs.ts`), directly analogous to
`RoomBreakableBlockDef.groupId` from Phase 2B — minted by its own counter in
`editorRoomBuilder.ts` (`nextContactDamageGroupId`), separate from the
breakable-block group counter, since the two arrays are never compared
against each other. A 1×1 damaging placement gets one ungrouped
(`groupId: -1`) entry; a 2×2 damaging placement gets four entries (one per
occupied cell) sharing one group id — **never** inferred by matching
adjacent cells with the same custom block ID, which would incorrectly merge
two separate touching placements of the same definition.

At contact time (`src/sim/hazards.ts`), when the player overlaps any cell of
a grouped placement, the handler scans every cell sharing that `groupId`
(only counting cells still active — see below) to compute the union AABB
*before* deciding on the damage source point, then calls
`applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback` **once** and `break`s out of the scan. This
guarantees:

- Contacting two or more cells of the same 2×2 placement in one simulation
  update still produces exactly one damage attempt, with a source point
  derived from the whole placement's footprint (not whichever single cell
  happened to be scanned first).
- Two adjacent, distinct placements (even of the same underlying block
  definition) never have their cells merged — each keeps its own `groupId`
  and its own damage tier.
- `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback`'s own `invulnerabilityTicks` gate is the
  ultimate backstop: even if two *different* placements were both contacted
  in the same tick, at most one produces a real effect, since the first
  successful call sets `invulnerabilityTicks` for the rest of the tick (and
  well beyond it) and the scan `break`s after the first overlapping cell
  regardless.

`isContactDamageBlockActiveFlag` deactivates contact-damage cells when their
underlying fragile block is destroyed (see below) — indestructible damaging
blocks simply stay active for the room's lifetime.

### Interaction with Fragile Blocks

A block may combine `breakability: fragile` with `contactDamage: low | high`.
The two properties are independent axes checked by two separate,
uncorrelated array-driven loops in `applyHazards`, run in this order every
tick:

1. **Custom block contact damage** runs first. It is a plain solid-contact
   check with no momentum requirement — the player takes damage on contact
   regardless of speed, exactly like touching a spike.
2. **Breakable blocks** runs second, applying its own unchanged momentum
   threshold (`BREAKABLE_MOMENTUM_THRESHOLD_WORLD`, untouched by this phase)
   to decide whether to perform the existing atomic destruction transaction.

**A real ordering bug was found and fixed while writing this phase's
tests**: `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback` mutates the player's velocity as
part of its knockback blend. Since the breakable-block section originally
recomputed the player's speed from *current* velocity, a fragile+damaging
block's own knockback could sap enough momentum to make the very same hit
fail the momentum threshold immediately afterward — silently preventing
fragile+damaging blocks from ever breaking on the hit that damaged the
player. The fix: the player's speed is now captured once, immediately before
the contact-damage section runs (`playerSpeedBeforeContactDamage`), and the
breakable-block section uses that captured value instead of recomputing it
post-knockback. This preserves every pre-existing hazard interaction
(spikes/springboards/water/lava still run, and can still affect this
captured speed, exactly as before) while decoupling the momentum check from
contact-damage's own velocity mutation.

With this fix, a fragile+damaging block that is struck fast enough to break
applies its damage **and** breaks in the same tick — one damage attempt, one
atomic destruction, never four damage attempts from a 2×2 group's four
cells. Duplicate/re-entrant calls to `applyHazards` on an already-broken
placement produce neither additional damage nor additional destruction (the
same active-flag and invulnerability guards apply).

### Transparent Pixels

Contact detection is purely position-based (cell center ± half the block
size) — it never reads `pixelData` or alpha values. A fully transparent
custom block (as every registry test in this phase uses, via
`makeBlankPixelData`) damages the player identically to an opaque one;
transparent pixels never create a "safe" hole in the collision/damage
surface.

### Backward Compatibility

- Schema-v1 blocks, and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2D, load exactly
  as before and resolve `contactDamage` to `'none'` with zero validation
  errors.
- All existing stable IDs, room references, collision/friction presets,
  1×1/2×2 fragile behavior, material-response sounds/particles, built-in
  hazards and damage, and export/campaign relocation are unchanged.
- The break momentum threshold is unchanged; no resistance tiers were added.
- Room reload semantics are unchanged: contact-damage cells (like breakable
  cells) are transient `WorldState` arrays rebuilt from `RoomDef` on every
  room load — nothing about "has this block already damaged the player"
  persists across a reload.
- Campaigns with no custom blocks at all are entirely unaffected —
  `room.contactDamageBlocks` is simply `undefined`/absent.

### Tests (Phase 2D)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2D.test.ts` (33 tests) exercises the
real pipeline (`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` → `loadRoomHazards` → `applyHazards`)
for every damage-application scenario rather than only asserting registry
mappings — schema-v1/v2 defaults, all three presets round-tripping,
unknown-value fallback with a structured diagnostic, the
`contactDamageRequiresSolid` compatibility rule (both directions: editor-save
rejection data and load-time safe fallback), real low/high damage
application via `applyHazards`, proximity-without-collision producing no
damage, sustained multi-tick contact producing only one hit while
invulnerable, grouped 2×2 ownership/deduplication (including adjacent
distinct placements), knockback direction following the contacted side,
transparent-pixel independence, the fragile+damage interaction order (including
the ordering bug fix above), indestructible damaging blocks remaining
present, dirty-tracking/undo-redo/rename/duplicate at the data-model level,
the sprite-cache properties-only update (asserting the cached canvas object
reference is unchanged), and export/relocation and campaign-switch
isolation. Three pre-existing round-trip-equality assertions
(`customBlockProperties.test.ts` tests 2 and 17, and
`customBlocksPhase2B.test.ts` test 24) were updated to include
`contactDamage: 'none'` in their expected literals, since the resolved
property bundle now legitimately has one more field — no other Phase
2A/2B/2C test was touched, and all 881 tests in the suite pass.

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (881/881
  passing), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running
  game or editor session for this phase either. As documented in the Phase
  2C section above, this environment's headless Chromium reproducibly stalls
  or crashes on this project's editor/campaign-loading flows — confirmed
  again to be a pre-existing, base-branch-reproducible limitation, not
  something introduced by this phase (see Phase 2C's "Manual Validation"
  section for the investigation). All verification here was done through
  the automated test suite exercising the real `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`,
  `loadRoomHazards`, and `applyHazards` code paths (not mocks) — but no
  actual frame was rendered, no actual collision was observed visually, and
  no actual knockback/damage feedback was seen by a human or an automated UI
  driver.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually create
  low- and high-damage solid blocks (both 1×1 and 2×2, fragile and
  indestructible), touch each side and the top surface, confirm normal
  invulnerability behavior on sustained contact, place two identical
  damaging blocks beside each other, and confirm material-specific break
  feedback still fires correctly for a fragile+damaging block, before
  shipping.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **No trigger-volume system** — contact damage only applies to solid
   blocks; a future phase could add a genuinely non-blocking damage/trigger
   zone, but that is explicitly out of scope here.
2. **Two fixed tiers only** — no resistance tiers, no per-block numeric
   tuning, no damage-over-time; `low`/`high` map to fixed constants.
3. **Contact-damage cells are transient, room-scoped state** — like
   breakable-block state, nothing persists across a room reload (matches
   existing behavior, not a regression).
4. **`MAX_CONTACT_DAMAGE_BLOCKS = 32`** is a hard per-room ceiling on
   damaging cells, mirroring `MAX_BREAKABLE_BLOCKS`.
5. **The ordering-bug fix (`playerSpeedBeforeContactDamage`) is scoped
   narrowly** — it only changes what velocity the breakable-block section
   reads for its momentum check; it does not change how spikes, springboards,
   water, or lava zones interact with each other or with breakable blocks,
   preserving all pre-existing hazard-ordering behavior.

## Phase 2E: Break-Resistance Presets

Phase 2E adds an engine-defined `breakResistance` property so a fragile
custom block can select how much player momentum is required to break it,
extending the existing single-threshold breakable-block system rather than
introducing block health, accumulated damage, or repair.

### The New Property and Defaults

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "collision": "solid",
    "friction": "default",
    "breakability": "fragile",
    "breakResistance": "reinforced",
    "materialResponse": "metal",
    "contactDamage": "none"
  }
}
```

`breakResistance` is a strict enum — `'weak' | 'standard' | 'reinforced'` —
added to `CustomBlockProperties` (`src/levels/customBlockProperties.ts`)
alongside the properties from Phases 2A/2C/2D. No schema version bump:
`CUSTOM_BLOCK_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays `2`. Defaults to `'standard'`:

- Schema-v1 blocks (no `properties` object at all).
- Schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2E (`properties` present,
  `breakResistance` absent).
- Unregistered/missing custom block definitions (`DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES`).
- Built-in (non-custom-block) breakable blocks authored directly in a room,
  which have no `breakResistance` field on `RoomBreakableBlockDef` at all —
  `'standard'` is byte-identical to the original global threshold, so every
  existing built-in breakable block is completely unaffected.

Unknown values (e.g. `"breakResistance": "adamantine"`) never crash — they
produce a structured `CustomBlockValidationError`
(`field: 'properties.breakResistance'`) via `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties`
and fall back to `'standard'`. Saving through the editor always writes the
resolved value explicitly. Only the enum ID is ever serialized — never a raw
momentum number, threshold, or physics value.

### Registry and Centralized Threshold Mappings

`BREAK_RESISTANCE_PRESET_REGISTRY` follows the exact `PresetMeta<T>` shape
every other preset registry uses:

| Preset | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `weak` | Weak | Breaks from lighter impacts. |
| `standard` | Standard | Uses the existing break threshold. |
| `reinforced` | Reinforced | Requires a substantially stronger impact. |

`breakResistanceToIndex` / `indexToBreakResistance` pack the enum into a
`0|1|2` index for `Uint8Array` storage, the same pattern
`materialResponseToIndex`/`contactDamageTierToIndex` established.

**The single authoritative threshold-selection function** is
`resolveBreakThresholdWorld(resistanceIndex)` in `src/sim/hazards.ts` — the
only place in the codebase that maps a resistance tier to a momentum number.
No other code path (collision, editor, hazard loading) compares resistance
tiers directly.

| Tier | Threshold (world units/s) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `weak` | 150 | Just above sprint speed (`MAX_RUN_SPEED_WORLD_PER_SEC × SPRINT_SPEED_MULTIPLIER` ≈ 157.5) — normal running/walking (105) and any resting/low-speed contact never break it, but a bare sprint reliably does. |
| `standard` | 250 (`BREAKABLE_MOMENTUM_THRESHOLD_WORLD`, unchanged) | The original single global threshold, preserved byte-for-byte. |
| `reinforced` | 350 | Above a fast dive alone (`FAST_MAX_FALL_APPROACH_PER_SEC` = 300) but reachable by combining a fast dive with horizontal sprint/grapple-zip momentum, or chaining a grapple-zip release into a dash — deliberately achievable through normal high-speed play, never impossible. |

These values were chosen after surveying `src/sim/clusters/movementConstants.ts`
and `grappleZip.ts` for StickBlade's real movement speed scale (`MAX_RUN_SPEED_WORLD_PER_SEC`
= 105, sprint ≈ 157.5, `GRAPPLE_ZIP_SPEED_WORLD_PER_SEC` = 210,
`FAST_MAX_FALL_APPROACH_PER_SEC` = 300) rather than picked arbitrarily.

### Compatibility

`breakResistance` is meaningful only when `breakability: 'fragile'` **and**
`collision: 'solid'` — unlike `contactDamageRequiresSolid`, there is **no
rejection rule** for other combinations. An indestructible or non-solid
block may still have a `breakResistance` value; it is simply retained and
inert (never read by any runtime code path, since
`isEligibleForBreakablePathway` already gates the entire breakable pathway
on fragile+solid). This means switching a block from indestructible back to
fragile restores the creator's previously chosen tier with zero extra
plumbing — the property was never touched or reset in the first place.
Fragile combined with `oneWay` or `nonSolid` collision is still rejected by
the existing (Phase 2A) `fragileRequiresSolid` rule, unchanged.

### Editor Integration

- A **Break resistance** dropdown was added to the custom-block dialog's
  Properties section (`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts`), built with the same
  generic `makePropertyRow` helper every other property uses.
- The control is visually and functionally disabled (dimmed, `select.disabled`)
  whenever `breakability !== 'fragile'`, via a new `refreshBreakResistanceEnabled()`
  helper called from the existing `refreshCompatibilityMessage()` (itself
  already invoked after every property change and by `refreshPropertyControls()`
  during undo/redo) — no new call sites were needed. Disabling the control
  never resets its underlying value.
- `propertiesEqual` (drives dirty-state detection) now also compares
  `breakResistance`, so a resistance-only change is correctly flagged dirty.
- Undo/redo needed no new plumbing — each snapshot is already the full
  `{ pixelData, properties }` object.
- Rename and Duplicate both pass `def.properties` straight through
  `serializeCustomBlock`, preserving/copying `breakResistance` with zero
  resistance-specific code.
- The palette card badge (`editorUI.ts`) now appends ` · Weak` /
  ` · Reinforced` (nothing for `standard`, and nothing at all for
  indestructible blocks, where the value is inert) alongside the existing
  badges.
- No raw momentum threshold, numeric tuning, or physics value is ever
  exposed in the UI — only the three-value enum dropdown.

### Runtime Data Flow

`breakResistance` is resolved and validated exactly once, in the same place
as every other property — inside `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties`,
called from `parseCustomBlockSource` at block-registration time. The
simulation loop never parses JSON or compares untrusted strings; `src/sim/hazards.ts`
only ever reads a packed `Uint8Array` tier index
(`world.breakableBlockResistance`) resolved ahead of time by
`gameRoomHazards.ts` at room-load time, and passes it through
`resolveBreakThresholdWorld` for the momentum comparison.

A breakResistance-only edit does not rebuild the pixel sprite — it reuses
the exact `updateCustomBlockProperties` fast path Phase 2C introduced.
Campaign switching clears resistance profiles exactly as it already cleared
the other four properties: `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` empties the whole
property cache, and `world.breakableBlockResistance` is fully repopulated by
`loadRoomHazards` on the next room load. Missing/unregistered definitions
fall back to `DEFAULT_CUSTOM_BLOCK_PROPERTIES.breakResistance = 'standard'`.

Because `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` re-resolves each placement's properties
fresh from the sprite cache every time it runs, changing a block
definition's `breakResistance` tier and re-running that conversion
automatically updates every placement of that block — no placement
coordinates are rewritten.

### 1×1 and 2×2 Semantics

For a 1×1 fragile placement, `editorRoomBuilder.ts` writes the resolved
`breakResistance` onto its single `RoomBreakableBlockDef` entry. For a 2×2
placement, the SAME resolved value is written onto all four cells sharing
the placement's `groupId` — resolved once, not per cell, so there is no way
for the four cells of one placement to disagree. At contact time
(`src/sim/hazards.ts`), the struck cell's own `breakableBlockResistance`
value is read and passed through `resolveBreakThresholdWorld` — because
every cell in the group already carries the identical value by construction,
this is equivalent to (and cheaper than) re-deriving a "group resistance" by
scanning every member cell.

- **Sub-threshold impact**: leaves all four cells of the group fully intact
  (the existing atomic all-or-nothing group-destroy transaction from Phase
  2B never begins).
- **Qualifying impact**: destroys all four cells atomically in the same
  tick, exactly as Phase 2B's group-destroy transaction already does —
  Phase 2E only changes what counts as "qualifying," not the destruction
  transaction itself.
- **Adjacent groups** (even of different resistance tiers, or the same
  definition) remain fully independent, since each group's cells are only
  ever compared against cells sharing the exact same `groupId`.
- **Duplicate/re-entrant calls**: the pre-existing per-cell active-flag guard
  means an already-broken group's cells are skipped entirely on subsequent
  `applyHazards()` calls — no additional break event and no additional
  destruction attempt.
- **One break event per placement**: unchanged from Phase 2C — resistance
  only gates whether `emitBreakEvent` is ever reached, not how many times it
  fires once a qualifying hit occurs.

### Interaction with Contact Damage (Phase 2D)

Break resistance and contact damage are independent, uncorrelated checks —
resistance only affects the breakable-block section (which now reads
`resolveBreakThresholdWorld(world.breakableBlockResistance[i])` instead of
the old flat constant); contact damage's own section is completely
unaffected and still runs first, unconditional on player momentum. This
means:

- A `reinforced` + damaging block still applies its contact damage even
  when the player's momentum is well below the reinforced threshold — the
  block just doesn't break from that particular hit.
- A `weak` fragile+damaging 2×2 block that both damages the player and
  breaks in the same tick still applies contact damage **exactly once**
  (unaffected by resistance — deduplication comes from Phase 2D's own
  `contactDamageBlockGroupId` grouping and `applyPlayerDamageWithKnockback`'s
  invulnerability gate, neither of which this phase touches).
- Player invulnerability, knockback formula, and contact-damage tier values
  (low=1/high=2) are entirely unchanged by this phase.

### Interaction with Material Response (Phase 2C)

Resistance controls only *whether* destruction occurs, never the break
feedback once it does:

- `materialResponse` still selects the break sound and particle profile
  exactly as before — resistance is never read by `emitBreakEvent`,
  `BreakEffectRenderer`, or `breakSfx.ts`.
- One logical placement still emits exactly one break event, regardless of
  its resistance tier.
- Particle counts (`resolveBreakParticleCount`) are a function of material +
  grouped-or-not + graphics quality only — resistance was not added as a
  new input, per this phase's explicit constraint against varying cosmetic
  intensity by resistance.
- Resistance never touches or derives from authored sprite/pixel data.

### Backward Compatibility

- Schema-v1 blocks, and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2E, load exactly
  as before and resolve `breakResistance` to `'standard'` with zero
  validation errors.
- Built-in breakable blocks (hand-authored `breakableBlocks` room entries,
  not custom-block-driven) have no `breakResistance` field and default to
  `'standard'` at hazard-load time — byte-identical momentum threshold (250)
  to every pre-Phase-2E room.
- All existing stable IDs, room references, collision/friction presets,
  fragile 1×1/2×2 atomic destruction, material-response sounds/particles,
  contact-damage behavior, and export/campaign relocation are unchanged
  except that a NON-standard resistance tier now changes the momentum
  required to break a block that explicitly opts into one.
- Room reload semantics are unchanged: resistance is resolved fresh from
  `RoomDef.breakableBlocks` on every room load — nothing persists across a
  reload beyond what already didn't persist before this phase.

### Tests (Phase 2E)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2E.test.ts` (32 tests) exercises the
real pipeline (`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` → `loadRoomHazards` → `applyHazards`)
for every threshold scenario rather than only asserting registry mappings —
schema-v1/v2 defaults, all three presets round-tripping, unknown-value
fallback with a structured diagnostic, `standard` matching the pre-existing
threshold exactly (240 wu/s does not break, 260 wu/s does), real per-tier
momentum application at velocities chosen between/above each of the three
thresholds (200, 300, 400 wu/s) and at resting/low speed, grouped 2×2
shared-resistance destruction (all four cells carry the same tier,
sub-threshold leaves the group intact, qualifying impact destroys all four
atomically with exactly one break event, adjacent differently-tiered groups
remain independent, duplicate calls emit no additional events), indestructible
blocks ignoring resistance at runtime while still retaining it through an
indestructible→fragile round trip, dirty-tracking/undo-redo/rename/duplicate
at the data-model level, the sprite-cache properties-only update (asserting
canvas-object identity is unchanged), the Phase 2D contact-damage ordering
interaction (reinforced+damaging applies damage without breaking; weak
fragile+damaging 2×2 damages exactly once while also breaking), the Phase 2C
material-response interaction (one break event, correct material index),
export/relocation and campaign-switch isolation, and a built-in
(non-custom-block) breakable block confirmed to behave at exactly the
pre-Phase-2E 250 threshold. Two pre-existing round-trip-equality assertions
(`customBlockProperties.test.ts` tests 2 and 17) were updated to include
`breakResistance: 'standard'` in their expected literal, since the resolved
property bundle now legitimately has one more field — no other Phase
2A/2B/2C/2D test was touched, and all 913 tests in the suite pass.

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (913/913
  passing), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running
  game or editor session, for the same reason documented in the Phase 2C/2D
  sections above — this environment's headless Chromium reproducibly
  stalls/crashes on this project's editor/campaign-loading flows (confirmed
  base-branch-reproducible, not something this or any prior phase
  introduced). All verification here was done through the automated test
  suite exercising the real `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`, `loadRoomHazards`,
  and `applyHazards` code paths (not mocks) — but no actual frame was
  rendered, no actual grapple-assisted high-speed impact was performed, and
  no actual break sound/particle was observed by a human or an automated UI
  driver.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually create
  weak, standard, and reinforced fragile blocks (both 1×1 and 2×2), approach
  each at low/medium/grapple-assisted-high speed, confirm the three tiers
  feel distinct but all achievable, test adjacent grouped blocks and
  contact-damaging fragile blocks, confirm one sound/particle event per
  placement, and confirm older campaigns behave exactly as before, prior to
  shipping.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **No block health or accumulated damage** — a block either meets its
   threshold on a single hit and breaks atomically, or it doesn't; there is
   no partial-damage or multi-hit-to-break model.
2. **No per-block numeric tuning** — only the three fixed tiers exist; a
   future phase could add more granularity, but that would require revisiting
   the enum-only JSON constraint deliberately kept in this phase.
3. **Resistance is retained-but-inert on indestructible/non-solid blocks**
   with no visible-in-JSON indication of that inertness beyond the editor's
   disabled control — a campaign JSON reader has to know the
   `contactDamageRequiresSolid`-style rule doesn't apply here, but there is
   also no `breakResistanceRequiresFragile`-style rejection to make the
   inertness self-documenting in the compatibility-issue list.
4. **The three threshold constants are fixed engine values**, not derived
   per-room or per-campaign — tuning them requires an engine code change,
   not a JSON change (by design, per this phase's constraints).

## Phase 2F: Wind-Transmission Presets

Continues directly from Phase 2E (`breakResistance`, present and stable —
`customBlocksPhase2E.test.ts` and the full suite were re-verified green
before this phase's first code change). Adds `windResponse`, a preset that
lets a solid custom block attenuate the existing pixel-material wind system
(`PixelMaterialSystem.applyWindForce`) reaching sand, water, and sandstone
particles standing behind it.

### The New Property and Defaults

```ts
readonly windResponse: CustomBlockWindResponsePreset; // 'passThrough' | 'dampen' | 'block'
```

Example campaign JSON, alongside every prior phase's properties:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "collision": "solid",
    "friction": "default",
    "breakability": "fragile",
    "materialResponse": "stone",
    "contactDamage": "none",
    "breakResistance": "standard",
    "windResponse": "block"
  }
}
```

`'passThrough'` is the default and a complete no-op — every pre-Phase-2F
campaign, and every block that never sets this field, resolves to it with
zero validation errors. Only enum ids are ever serialized; no numeric wind
multiplier, callback, or asset path is ever present in JSON.

### The Two Wind-Response Concepts (Naming Disambiguation)

StickBlade already had an unrelated "wind response" concept before this
phase: `getMaterialWindResponse(material)` in `pixelMaterialTypes.ts`, a
per-material multiplier (sand `1`, 2×2 sand `0.55`, water `1.3`, sandstone
`0.6`) describing how reactive a material itself is to wind that reaches it.
This phase's property answers a different question — how much force reaches
a pixel at all, given the custom blocks standing between the emitter and
that pixel — so it was deliberately named `CustomBlockWindResponsePreset`
(not `WindResponsePreset`), and its resolution function
`resolveCustomBlockWindTransmission` (not a second `getWindResponse`), to
keep the two concepts textually and semantically distinct. The full formula
applied per affected particle is:

```
velocity delta = forceX/Y * distanceFalloff * customBlockTransmission * materialWindResponse
```

`distanceFalloff` and `materialWindResponse` are completely unchanged by
this phase; `customBlockTransmission` is the only new term, and it defaults
to exactly `1` (no-op) whenever no custom block sits between the emitter and
the particle.

### Registry and the Centralized Transmission Factor

`CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_RESPONSE_PRESET_IDS = ['passThrough', 'dampen', 'block']`
and `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_RESPONSE_PRESET_REGISTRY` follow the same
`PresetMeta<T>` shape as every other preset registry. Numeric packing
(`windResponseTierToIndex` / `indexToWindResponseTier`) follows the
`contactDamage` convention exactly: only the two "active" tiers (`'dampen'`
→ 0, `'block'` → 1) are ever packed into a `Uint8Array` slot —
`'passThrough'` is never stored numerically at all, since a pass-through
block simply has no entry in the runtime wind-transmission mask (see
`isEligibleForWindTransmission`).

The centralized dampening multiplier lives in
`src/sim/pixelMaterials/customBlockWindMask.ts`:

```ts
export const CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_DAMPEN_FACTOR = 0.4;
```

Chosen (not blindly copied from the suggested 0.35–0.5 range) by relating it
to the existing per-material `windResponse` table: those values span
0.55–1.3, so `0.4` sits below that entire range — a dampened impulse is
therefore always measurably weaker than even the heaviest existing
material's own response would otherwise produce, while remaining clearly
distinguishable from `'block'`'s exact `0`. `'block'` transmits exactly `0`;
`'passThrough'`/no-occluder transmits exactly `1`. These three values are
converted from a tier by the single function
`resolveCustomBlockWindTransmission` — no other call site branches on a tier
or hardcodes a factor.

### Compatibility

One new rule, `windResponseRequiresSolid`, added to
`checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility`:

- `windResponse !== 'passThrough'` combined with `collision !== 'solid'` is
  flagged — a one-way or non-solid block has no continuous native-pixel
  footprint for the ray-trace to treat as an occluder. `'passThrough'` is
  always valid regardless of collision.
- Both indestructible and fragile solid blocks may use any tier — wind
  transmission is completely independent of breakability, mirroring how
  `contactDamage` is independent of `breakability`.
- At load time, an incompatible combination never rejects the block —
  `validateAndResolveCustomBlockProperties` safely forces `windResponse`
  back to `'passThrough'` and reports a diagnostic, the same
  fallback-not-reject pattern used for every other compatibility rule.
- In the editor, the same `refreshCompatibilityMessage()` hook (unchanged
  call site, extended body) surfaces the message and blocks Save, exactly
  like the pre-existing `contactDamageRequiresSolid` rule.

### Runtime Architecture: CustomBlockWindMask and Directional Occlusion

`src/sim/pixelMaterials/customBlockWindMask.ts` introduces `CustomBlockWindMask`,
a native-pixel-resolution `Uint8Array` (0 = no restriction, 1 = dampen,
2 = block) that deliberately mirrors the existing `SolidMask` class's shape
(`markRect`/`tierAt`/bounds handling) without touching or repurposing
`SolidMask` itself — a different array, a different meaning, built and owned
independently. It tracks a running non-zero-cell count so `isEmpty` is an
O(1) check rather than a scan, which is what the fast path (below) relies
on.

Directional occlusion is resolved by `traceMaxWindTransmissionTier`, a
bounded integer Bresenham line trace from the emitter's center to the
target particle's cell:

- **Beside vs. between**: only cells the line itself crosses are visited —
  a block standing next to the straight-line path, but not on it, is never
  consulted and therefore never affects the impulse.
- **Same-side-as-source**: a block beyond the emitter (not between the
  emitter and the particle) is likewise never on the traced segment, so it
  has no effect — occlusion is strictly directional.
- **Minimum-transmission-encountered policy**: the trace tracks the MAXIMUM
  tier seen along the path (tier ordering `0 < 1 < 2` is monotonic in
  restrictiveness, so max-tier ≡ min-transmission), converting to a float
  multiplier exactly once via `resolveCustomBlockWindTransmission` after the
  walk completes. This is what makes a 2-cell-thick dampening wall attenuate
  identically to a 1-cell-thick one, and what makes crossing a `'dampen'`
  cell then a `'block'` cell resolve to fully blocked rather than
  double-dampened — thickness and multiple distinct blocks never compound.
- The trace exits early the instant tier 2 (`'block'`) is seen, since no
  tier can exceed it.
- No heap allocation, no recursion, and a defensive `MAX_TRACE_STEPS` bound
  (4096) that no real room's native-pixel diagonal comes close to.

### Integration into applyWindForce

`PixelMaterialSystem.applyWindForce` (the single shared primitive already
used by every wind emitter — player-movement wind, and any future emitter,
with zero per-emitter special-casing) gained one new field
(`windMask: CustomBlockWindMask | null`) and one new computation per
newly-affected particle:

```ts
const transmission = maskActive && mask !== null
  ? resolveCustomBlockWindTransmission(traceMaxWindTransmissionTier(mask, centerXPx, centerYPx, x, y))
  : 1;
if (transmission <= 0) { affected.add(p); continue; } // fully blocked — no force, no wake.
...
p.windVelX += forceX * strength * transmission * response;
p.windVelY += forceY * strength * transmission * response;
```

Because the dedup check (`affected.has(p)`) runs before the transmission
computation, a multi-cell particle (e.g. 2×2 sand) still receives the trace
and impulse exactly once per `applyWindForce` call, regardless of how many
of its footprint cells fall within the force radius — the existing
Phase-3 dedup guarantee is untouched. No existing wind strength, radius,
falloff, damping, or per-material response constant was changed.

### Fast Path for passThrough-Only Rooms

`maskActive = mask !== null && !mask.isEmpty` is computed ONCE per
`applyWindForce` call, not per particle. When false (every pre-Phase-2F
room, and any room where every custom block is `'passThrough'`),
`transmission` is set to exactly `1` for every particle with no ray trace
ever invoked — behavior is byte-identical to pre-Phase-2F code. This was
verified directly: `customBlocksPhase2F.test.ts` asserts that a null
`windMask` and an explicitly-empty (but non-null) `CustomBlockWindMask`
produce IDENTICAL `windVelX` results for the same gust, and that
`traceMaxWindTransmissionTier` on an empty mask returns instantly (well
under a millisecond) even when asked to trace a 2000-pixel span.

### Fragile-Windbreak Invalidation and Tick Ordering

The real tick order (verified directly in `tick.ts`) is
`syncPixelMaterialSolidGeometry` → `applyMovementWindToPixelMaterials` →
`tickPixelMaterials` → `applyHazards` (last). Since fragile-block
destruction happens inside `applyHazards`, a windbreak destroyed this tick
is reflected starting the NEXT tick's wind application — the exact same
one-tick lag already accepted and documented for the analogous solid-mask
sync in `pixelMaterialSolidSync.ts`, not a new inconsistency introduced by
this phase.

`destroyBreakableBlockCell` (`sim/hazards.ts`) — the single shared
destruction function used by both the 1×1 and grouped 2×2 pathways — gained
one new branch: if the destroyed cell's packed `breakableBlockWindTier` is
non-zero, it calls `windMask.clearRect(...)` for exactly that cell's
native-pixel footprint (one block, always, even for a cell that's part of a
2×2 group — 2×2 fragile placements already decompose into four independent
1×1 breakable-block cells, so this is a targeted region clear, never a full
room-mask rebuild). For a grouped 2×2 windbreak, all four cells carry the
tier and are destroyed in the same pass, so the whole footprint is cleared
atomically.

This relies on a second, independent per-cell field —
`RoomBreakableBlockDef.windResponse` / `world.breakableBlockWindTier` — kept
deliberately separate from the room-load-time
`RoomDef.windTransmissionBlocks` list (which builds the INITIAL mask,
covering both fragile and indestructible windbreaks, one entry per
placement). The initial-mask list and the per-cell invalidation field serve
different purposes and are populated independently, exactly mirroring how
`materialResponse` and `contactDamage` are each resolved once, for their own
purpose, by their own consumer.

### 1×1 and 2×2 Semantics

`RoomWindTransmissionBlockDef` is registered ONCE PER PLACEMENT — not per
cell — since building the wind mask is a static, room-load-time rectangle
mark, not a per-tick runtime detection array like `breakableBlocks` or
`contactDamageBlocks`. A 2×2 placement therefore produces exactly one
`windTransmissionBlocks` entry (`{ xBlock, yBlock, wBlock: 2, hBlock: 2,
tier }`), marked as one `markRect` call covering the full footprint —
confirmed directly by test (a 2×2 block registers exactly one entry, not
four). Per-cell invalidation on fragile destruction (above) still operates
at the cell level, since that's how the breakable-block pathway already
tracks destruction — but since the four cells of a group are always
destroyed together, the net effect is that the whole 2×2 mask region is
always cleared atomically as one unit.

### Interaction with Sand, Water, and Sandstone

- **Sand**: pass-through preserves the exact pre-Phase-2F impulse; dampen
  reduces (never zeroes) it by exactly `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_DAMPEN_FACTOR`;
  block reduces it to exactly zero and does not wake a sleeping particle.
- **Water**: retains its own (higher, `1.3`) material-response multiplier
  after transmission is applied — dampening scales water and sand by the
  identical transmission factor, so their relative momentum ratio after a
  dampened gust is unchanged from their undampened ratio; dampening reduces
  water's response, it never replaces or overrides it.
- **Sandstone**: erosion accumulation (`p.erosionDamage += windSpeed *
  SANDSTONE_EROSION_RATE`) is purely downstream of `p.windVelX/Y`, so
  transmission scaling automatically affects erosion speed with zero
  sandstone-specific code changes — dampening erodes slower (confirmed by
  test: less accumulated damage than an identical undampened gust), a full
  windbreak prevents erosion entirely (confirmed: zero accumulated damage
  after 50 gust+step cycles behind a `'block'` wall), and
  `SANDSTONE_EROSION_THRESHOLD`/`SANDSTONE_EROSION_RATE` themselves are
  untouched. Player-impact fracture (`applyPlayerImpactFracture`) uses fixed
  impact-speed constants entirely independent of the wind mask and is
  unaffected (confirmed by test).
- **2×2 sand**: receives exactly one transmitted impulse per
  `applyWindForce` call regardless of footprint size, via the pre-existing
  dedup mechanism — confirmed by test that a 2×2 particle's resulting
  velocity never exceeds what a single dampened/blocked impulse could
  produce.

### Interaction with Other Custom-Block Properties

Verified independent, by test, against every other property this phase
touches: collision variants (wind transmission requires solid, exactly like
contact damage), slippery friction (untouched), all three contact-damage
tiers (a fragile windbreak can still damage the player on contact — the two
systems share no code path), player invulnerability (untouched), all three
break-resistance tiers (a windbreak can be weak, standard, or reinforced —
its own threshold governs when it breaks, independent of its wind tier),
material-specific break sounds/particles (a metal windbreak still emits
exactly one material-specific break event when destroyed), and stable
IDs/placement ownership (adjacent windbreak placements — one fragile, one
indestructible — remain fully independent; breaking one never clears the
other's mask region).

### Editor Integration

`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts` gained one more `makePropertyRow` call
(`windResponseCtl`, labels "Pass-through" / "Dampen" / "Windbreak"),
threaded through `propertiesEqual` (dirty-tracking), the undo/redo snapshot
(already a full `{pixelData, properties}` object — no new snapshot shape
needed), and `refreshPropertyControls` (rename/duplicate/reload sync) —
exactly the same call-site pattern as every prior phase's dropdown, no new
architecture. `editorUI.ts`'s palette card gained a `windBadge` (`· Dampens
wind` / `· Windbreak`, no badge for the silent `'passThrough'` default),
appended to the existing collision/friction/breakability/material/damage/
resistance badge line.

### Backward Compatibility

- Schema-v1 blocks, and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2F, load exactly
  as before and resolve `windResponse` to `'passThrough'` with zero
  validation errors.
- Built-in (hand-authored, non-custom-block) `breakableBlocks` room entries
  have no `windResponse` field and default to packed tier `0` — never
  registered as a windbreak, confirmed by test.
- A room with no custom blocks at all (or only `'passThrough'` ones) builds
  a `windMask` with `isEmpty === true`, and wind behaves byte-identically to
  every pre-Phase-2F room — confirmed by test.
- Built-in walls and platforms are completely unaffected — only custom
  blocks explicitly registered in `RoomDef.windTransmissionBlocks` (which is
  populated exclusively from custom-block placements in
  `editorRoomBuilder.ts`) ever appear in the mask; ordinary authored walls
  never globally block wind.
- Existing wind emitters (movement-generated wind via
  `pixelMaterialMovementWind.ts`) call the same `applyWindForce` with no
  changes to their own call sites — transmission is applied transparently
  inside the shared primitive.
- Export/relocation and room reload are unchanged: the mask is rebuilt fresh
  from `RoomDef.windTransmissionBlocks` on every `loadRoomPixelMaterials`
  call, exactly like the solid mask.
- Sprite caching: `updateCustomBlockProperties` updates `windResponse`
  without rebuilding the cached canvas, confirmed by test (same canvas
  object instance before/after).

### Performance Considerations

- The fast path (`maskActive` computed once per `applyWindForce` call) means
  a room with zero dampen/block blocks pays zero extra cost versus
  pre-Phase-2F code — no per-particle branch beyond one boolean check.
- The Bresenham trace is allocation-free and bounded; it only runs for
  newly-affected particles (already deduped), never per footprint cell of a
  multi-cell particle, and never for a room with an empty mask.
- `CustomBlockWindMask`'s `isEmpty` is an O(1) counter check, not a scan.
- `clearRect`/`markRect` touch only the affected rectangle, never the whole
  mask — room-load builds the mask once via bounded `markRect` calls (one
  per eligible placement), and fragile destruction clears one cell's
  rectangle at a time, never triggering a full mask rebuild.

### Tests (Phase 2F)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2F.test.ts` (55 tests) exercises the
real pipeline end to end: schema-v1/v2 defaults, all three presets
round-tripping, unknown-value fallback with a structured diagnostic, numeric
packing round trip, the `windResponseRequiresSolid` compatibility rule
(rejecting oneWay/nonSolid + dampen/block, always accepting passThrough,
accepting solid + either tier regardless of breakability) and its load-time
safe-fallback, `CustomBlockWindMask` unit behavior (empty/non-empty,
markRect/clearRect, out-of-bounds reads, the empty-mask fast-return
performance check), direct `PixelMaterialSystem.applyWindForce` transmission
tests (null-mask/empty-mask equivalence, exact dampen-factor application,
exact-zero blocking without waking a sleeping particle, beside-vs-between
and same-side-as-source directional exclusion, 2-cell-thick vs. 1-cell-thick
non-compounding, dampen-then-block strongest-restriction, two distinct
dampen blocks not compounding below the single-block factor), per-material
retention (water's higher response preserved through dampening, sand
correctly reduced), sandstone erosion interaction (dampened erosion slower
but nonzero, full block prevents erosion entirely, player-impact fracture
unaffected), 2×2 single-impulse dedup with transmission, real room-builder
wiring (one `windTransmissionBlocks` entry per placement — 1×1 and 2×2 alike
— never per cell, no entry at all for passThrough, `loadRoomPixelMaterials`
building a correctly-populated non-empty mask, a passThrough-only room
building an empty one), fragile-windbreak invalidation through the real
`applyHazards` destruction pathway (unbroken 1×1 occludes / broken 1×1 no
longer does, a grouped 2×2 clears its whole footprint atomically on group
destruction, adjacent independent placements never affect each other,
indestructible windbreaks can never be cleared), interaction preservation
with contact damage/break-resistance/material-response, editor
dirty-tracking/undo-redo/rename/duplicate at the data-model level, the
sprite-cache properties-only update, export/relocation and campaign-switch
isolation, and built-in/no-custom-block backward compatibility. No other
Phase 2A-2E test file was touched, and all 968 tests in the full suite pass.

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (968/968
  passing), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase.
  `customBlocksPhase2F.test.ts`, the pixel-material test files
  (`pixelMaterials*.test.ts`), and the full custom-block test suite were
  additionally run directly and pass.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running
  game or editor session, for the same reason documented in every prior
  phase's section — this environment's headless Chromium reproducibly
  stalls/crashes on this project's editor/campaign-loading flows (confirmed
  base-branch-reproducible, not something this or any prior phase
  introduced). All verification here was done through the automated test
  suite exercising the real `PixelMaterialSystem.applyWindForce`,
  `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`, `loadRoomHazards`/`loadRoomPixelMaterials`, and
  `applyHazards` code paths (not mocks) — but no actual frame was rendered,
  no wind visual/debug overlay was observed by a human or automated UI
  driver, and no actual player-driven gust or windbreak destruction was
  triggered through real input.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually create
  pass-through, dampen, and windbreak blocks (both 1×1 and 2×2), place
  sand/water/sandstone behind each, generate wind from both sides, confirm
  only the shielded side is affected, break a fragile windbreak and confirm
  wind passes through on the very next visible frame, test weak/reinforced
  fragile windbreaks, confirm contact damage and break destruction still
  feel correct, save/reopen/export/relocate/reopen, and confirm older
  campaigns are visually and behaviorally unchanged, prior to shipping.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **No wind-caused block movement or damage** — a custom block's own
   `windResponse` never moves, damages, or destroys the block itself; it
   only changes wind transmission to particles behind it, by design.
2. **A single global dampening factor** — `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_DAMPEN_FACTOR`
   applies to every `'dampen'` block in every room; there is no per-block
   numeric override (deliberately, to keep campaign JSON free of arbitrary
   physics numbers).
3. **No directional vents or wind sources on custom blocks** — this phase
   only lets a block ATTENUATE wind passing through; it cannot yet emit,
   redirect, or amplify wind itself.
4. **No liquid-specific interaction** — a windbreak affects water's wind
   momentum exactly like sand's, but did not (as of Phase 2F) seal, drain, or
   otherwise interact with pixel-material liquid or water-zone buoyancy.
   **Addressed in Phase 2G below** for pixel-material liquid specifically —
   water-zone buoyancy remains a separate, still-unaddressed system (see
   Phase 2G's own Remaining Limitations).

## Phase 2G: Liquid-Interaction Presets

### The New Property and Defaults

A fourth engine-owned property, `liquidInteraction`, selects how a custom
block interacts with **pixel-material liquids** — currently only water,
identified structurally via `getMaterialBehavior(material) === 'liquid'`
rather than a hardcoded material id, so a future second liquid material
would need no changes to this phase's mask/movement code:

```ts
type CustomBlockLiquidInteractionPreset = 'none' | 'seal' | 'drain';
```

- **`'none'`** (the default) — no additional liquid behavior. A solid block
  still blocks pixel-material occupancy via the pre-existing solid mask, as
  it always has; this preset adds nothing on top of that.
- **`'seal'`** — pixel-material liquid cannot fall, diagonal-fall, or spread
  horizontally into this block's footprint, independently of player
  collision.
- **`'drain'`** — pixel-material liquid attempting to enter this block's
  footprint is deterministically removed (not merely stopped).

Schema version stays **2** — no bump was needed, matching Phase 2C-2F.
Schema-v1 blocks and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2G both resolve
`liquidInteraction` to `'none'` via the same "field absent → default, not an
error" path already used for `materialResponse`/`contactDamage`/
`breakResistance`/`windResponse`. An unrecognized string value produces a
structured `CustomBlockValidationError` (`field:
'properties.liquidInteraction'`) and falls back to `'none'`, never throwing.

### No Collision Requirement (Deliberately Unlike Wind/Contact Damage)

Every property added in Phases 2D-2F (`contactDamage`, `windResponse`)
required `collision: 'solid'`, because both rode on the solid custom-block's
wall footprint. `liquidInteraction` is **the first property with no such
requirement** — `isEligibleForLiquidInteraction` checks only
`liquidInteraction !== 'none'`:

- A **solid** block already blocks all pixel-material occupancy via the
  existing solid mask; `'seal'` there is redundant but explicit (and
  harmless — the two independent checks don't double-block or conflict).
- A **one-way** block can seal/drain liquid while its one-way player
  collision is completely untouched — the player still passes through from
  below and stands on top exactly as before.
- A **non-solid** block can be a pure liquid-only barrier or drain that the
  player walks through freely — there is no other way to place an
  invisible-to-the-player liquid gate in this engine today.

`checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility` therefore has **no new rule** for
this property — all nine `(collision × liquidInteraction)` combinations are
valid.

### Registry and Numeric Packing

`CUSTOM_BLOCK_LIQUID_INTERACTION_PRESET_REGISTRY` provides the editor
label/description for each preset. Numeric packing
(`liquidInteractionTierToIndex`/`indexToLiquidInteractionTier`) follows the
same "the inert default is never stored" convention as
`windResponseTierToIndex`: `'none'` has no packed index at all (blocks with
no liquid interaction simply have no entry in the runtime arrays), and
`'seal'`/`'drain'` pack to `0`/`1`.

### Runtime Architecture: CustomBlockLiquidMask

`src/sim/pixelMaterials/customBlockLiquidMask.ts` defines `CustomBlockLiquidMask`,
architecturally a sibling of `CustomBlockWindMask` (Phase 2F) — a native-pixel
resolution `Uint8Array`, one byte per cell, storing a tier (`0 = none`,
`1 = seal`, `2 = drain`) with an `isEmpty` fast-path flag maintained via a
`nonZeroCells` counter. It is a **completely separate object** from
`SolidMask` and `CustomBlockWindMask` — no repurposing of either — reachable
as `PixelMaterialSystem.liquidMask` (default `null`, treated identically to
an empty mask).

Unlike the wind mask, there is **no ray-tracing**: liquid movement only ever
needs to test the immediate destination cell(s) of one candidate move, never
a line between two distant points, so `tierAt(x, y)` is the only query
primitive needed — a plain O(1) array read.

`markRect` resolves overlapping writes to the **higher tier**
(`drain(2) > seal(1) > none(0)`), order-independent — a defensive measure for
malformed/legacy data, even though the room builder (below) already rejects
overlapping liquid-modifier placements at registration time, so in practice
no two placements ever contest the same cell.

### Room-Load Registration and Overlap Rejection

`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` (editorRoomBuilder.ts) registers one
`RoomLiquidInteractionBlockDef` entry **per eligible placement** (never per
cell, 1×1 and 2×2 alike) into `RoomDef.liquidInteractionBlocks` — mirroring
`RoomWindTransmissionBlockDef`'s one-entry-per-placement shape. Because
liquid interaction has no collision requirement, this registration runs
**before** the `!behavior.generateWall` early-`continue` that skips
non-solid placements for wall generation, so a non-solid seal/drain block is
still registered.

The task's documented "drain > seal > none" **overlap policy** is enforced
at the strongest possible point — registration time, not runtime. A small
`claimedLiquidCells` set (keyed by block-grid cell, scoped to one
`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` call) tracks every cell already claimed by a
registered liquid-interaction placement; a new placement whose footprint
overlaps an already-claimed cell is **not registered for liquid
interaction** at all (its other properties — collision, friction, etc. — are
completely unaffected). This keeps the runtime mask's single-byte-per-cell
representation always unambiguous: every non-zero mask cell belongs to
exactly one placement, so a fragile placement's destruction can always
safely clear its own footprint without any risk of erasing an overlapping
neighbor's still-active effect — no reference-counting or ownership array
was needed. Custom block placements should not normally overlap in the
first place; this is a defensive guarantee for malformed or hand-edited
room data, not an expected authoring scenario.

`loadRoomPixelMaterials` (gameRoomPixelMaterials.ts) builds
`PixelMaterialSystem.liquidMask` from `RoomDef.liquidInteractionBlocks` at
room-load time, exactly mirroring `buildCustomBlockWindMaskFromRoom`.

### Integration into Liquid Movement (the Single Authoritative Pathway)

`PixelMaterialSystem.stepLiquidParticle` previously called `tryMoveParticle`
directly for each of its five candidate destinations (gravity, both
diagonals, wind-driven upward, both horizontal-spread directions). Phase 2G
replaces every one of those five call sites with a new private
`tryLiquidMove(p, nx, ny)` — **the single authoritative liquid-movement-
eligibility gate**, so seal/drain enforcement lives in exactly one place
rather than being duplicated five times:

```
final velocity/position outcome for a candidate destination:
  liquidMask null/empty  → tryMoveParticle(p, nx, ny)         (fast path, zero overhead)
  destination tier SEAL  → false (move rejected outright)
  destination tier DRAIN → drainParticle(p) if the destination is otherwise
                            reachable by the EXISTING rules (in bounds, not
                            solid, not occupied by anything but p itself);
                            returns true (move "consumed")
  destination tier NONE  → tryMoveParticle(p, nx, ny)          (unchanged)
```

**Seal** rejects the candidate destination unconditionally — the caller's
`||` cascade in `stepLiquidParticle` simply tries the next candidate (or
falls through to sleep bookkeeping if every candidate is sealed/blocked),
exactly as if that destination were solid. This is what makes a sealed cell
unavailable to liquid regardless of *which* movement rule tried to enter it
(gravity/diagonal/horizontal), and independent of whether the cell is
otherwise empty and non-solid.

**Drain** only ever triggers if the destination is otherwise reachable by
`isRegionFree` — i.e. the particle genuinely "attempts to enter" the drain
cell, matching the existing rules exactly (not a separate proximity/contact
check). This has a clean consequence documented as **the** solid+drain
semantics: a solid AND drain block never actually drains anything, because
the solid mask already prevents the particle from reaching the cell in the
first place — drain is simply moot there, not a special case requiring its
own branch.

`drainParticle` removes the particle **atomically** — clears all of its
footprint occupancy keys, deletes it from both `particles` and `activeSet`,
and wakes neighboring cells via the existing `wakeAround` — mirroring
`erase()`'s bookkeeping exactly. Because the caller's cascade returns `true`
immediately after draining, the particle is never processed again during
that same step (no double-drain, no stale references).

### Initial Authored-Liquid/Drain Overlap Policy

If a room's authored `pixelMaterials` places a liquid particle directly on a
drain cell, `loadRoomPixelMaterials` calls
`PixelMaterialSystem.dropLiquidsOverlappingDrainMask()` **once, immediately
after `loadFromDefs`**, before the room's first simulation step ever runs.
This was chosen over "let it disappear on the first `step()`" so a freshly
loaded room never renders even one frame of liquid sitting inside a drain
it's about to vanish from — the removal is invisible to the player rather
than a visible pop. Only particles whose material behavior is `'liquid'`
are affected; sand/sandstone sitting on a drain cell (which has no runtime
meaning for them) are left untouched.

### Fragile Invalidation and Tick Ordering

A fragile seal/drain block's liquid-mask footprint is cleared the moment it
breaks, via the same targeted-region/one-tick-lag precedent Phase 2F
established for the wind mask: `RoomBreakableBlockDef.liquidInteraction`
(optional, mirroring `windResponse`) is resolved once at hazard-load time
into a new packed `WorldState.breakableBlockLiquidTier` array (`0 = none`,
`1 = seal`, `2 = drain`), and `destroyBreakableBlockCell` (sim/hazards.ts)
calls `liquidMask.clearRect(...)` over exactly that cell's
`BLOCK_SIZE_MEDIUM` square when the tier is non-zero. A 1×1 fragile
placement clears one tile; a grouped 2×2 fragile placement clears all four
cells, one per `destroyBreakableBlockCell` call within the existing atomic
group-destroy loop — never a full mask rebuild. Because this runs inside
`applyHazards`, which the tick pipeline calls after that tick's liquid
`step()`, the mask is cleared **starting the next tick's liquid movement**
— the same one-tick lag already accepted for the wind mask and solid-mask
sync. Adjacent placements are matched by exact world-position and remain
completely independent (breaking one never touches a neighbor's mask
region, whether that neighbor is fragile-but-unbroken or indestructible).
An indestructible seal/drain block never enters the breakable pathway at
all and so can never be cleared by any destruction event.

### 1×1 and 2×2 Semantics

Both `RoomLiquidInteractionBlockDef` (initial mask) and
`RoomBreakableBlockDef.liquidInteraction` (invalidation) cover a 2×2
placement's complete four-cell footprint — the initial mask via one
`markRect` call spanning the whole placement, and invalidation via the
existing per-cell breakable-block decomposition (4 entries sharing one
`groupId`, already how 2×2 fragile blocks work since Phase 2B) triggering 4
independent `clearRect` calls, one per destroyed cell, when the group breaks
atomically.

### Interaction with Other Custom-Block Properties

`liquidInteraction` is fully independent of collision, friction,
breakability, material response, contact damage, break resistance, and wind
response — a fragile, reinforced, high-contact-damage, metal-sounding,
windbreak, drain block exercises every one of those systems on its own
existing pathway, untouched by this phase. Verified directly: contact
damage still applies on solid contact regardless of liquid interaction,
break-resistance thresholds are unaffected, sandstone impact
fracture/erosion is unaffected, and a metal block's break event still fires
exactly once with the correct material index when destroyed.

### Editor Integration

A "Liquid interaction" dropdown (None / Seal / Drain) was added to
`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts` following the exact `makePropertyRow` pattern
used for every prior preset — property changes mark the dialog dirty,
participate in the existing undo/redo snapshot stack, and are included in
Save/Discard/Keep-Editing. A small note under the dropdown clarifies that
this affects pixel-material water specifically, not authored water-zone
buoyancy. The palette summary in `editorUI.ts` gains a `Seals liquid`/`Drain`
badge (silent for the `'none'` default, matching every other preset's
badge convention). Rename and duplicate preserve the property automatically
because it is part of the same `properties` object as every other preset
(verified directly via `serializeCustomBlock`/`parseCustomBlockSource` round
trips). `updateCustomBlockProperties` changing only `liquidInteraction`
does not rebuild the cached sprite canvas (same object identity before and
after), matching the existing properties-only-update optimization.

### Backward Compatibility

- Schema-v1 blocks, and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2G, load exactly
  as before — `liquidInteraction` resolves to `'none'`, which has zero
  runtime effect (no mask entry, no movement-pathway change).
- Rooms/campaigns with no custom blocks at all build a `null`-then-populated
  `liquidMask` that is always empty — `stepLiquidParticle`'s fast path makes
  this byte-identical to pre-Phase-2G liquid movement.
- Sand, sandstone, player collision, water-zone buoyancy/submersion, wind
  transmission, and every other Phase 2A-2F behavior are completely
  unaffected — verified directly by tests that place a liquid mask alongside
  each of those systems and confirm no change.
- A hand-authored `RoomBreakableBlockDef` with no `liquidInteraction` field
  (pre-Phase-2G shape) resolves to tier `0` and is never treated as a
  seal/drain cell.

### Performance Considerations

- `CustomBlockLiquidMask.tierAt` is a single `Uint8Array` read — O(1),
  no allocation.
- `tryLiquidMove`'s fast path (`liquidMask === null || liquidMask.isEmpty`)
  is a direct passthrough to the pre-existing `tryMoveParticle` call with
  zero extra work for the overwhelming majority of rooms (any room with no
  seal/drain blocks) — verified by a test placing 200 liquid particles and
  stepping 50 times with an empty mask, completing well under the test's
  time budget.
- No custom-block placement list is scanned during any particle movement —
  the mask is built once at room-load time; the hot path only ever reads
  the mask, never the placement list.
- `drainParticle` and `dropLiquidsOverlappingDrainMask` allocate nothing new
  per particle beyond the pre-existing `Array.from(this.particles)`
  snapshot the latter already needs to safely mutate `particles` during
  iteration (a one-time, room-load-only cost, not a per-tick one).

### Tests (Phase 2G)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2G.test.ts` (65 tests) exercises the
real pipeline end to end: schema-v1/v2 defaults, all three presets
round-tripping, unknown-value fallback with a structured diagnostic, numeric
packing round trip, the (deliberate lack of a) collision-compatibility rule
for all nine `(collision × liquidInteraction)` combinations,
`CustomBlockLiquidMask` unit behavior (empty/non-empty, markRect/clearRect,
deterministic order-independent overlap resolution), fast-path equivalence
(null mask vs. empty mask vs. no mask at all produce byte-identical liquid
movement), direct seal enforcement (blocks downward/diagonal/horizontal
entry, an unrelated sealed cell has no effect, solid+seal and
non-solid+seal both work as documented), direct drain enforcement (removes
liquid attempting downward/diagonal/horizontal entry, never removes
sand/sandstone, leaves no occupancy/active-set remnants, never
double-drains, solid+drain never drains because the particle can never
reach the cell), the room-init drain-overlap policy, 2×2 footprint coverage
for both seal and drain, adjacent-placement independence, real
room-builder wiring (one `liquidInteractionBlocks` entry per placement,
none for `'none'`, non-solid placements still register,
`loadRoomPixelMaterials` building a correctly-populated mask),
overlap-rejection at room-build time, fragile invalidation through the real
`applyHazards` destruction pathway (1×1 seal/drain and grouped 2×2 all
clear correctly, adjacent placements stay independent, indestructible
modifiers can never be cleared), interaction preservation with wind/
sandstone/contact-damage/break-resistance (including a fragile, reinforced,
damaging, metal, drain block exercising every system at once), editor
dirty-tracking/undo-redo/rename/duplicate at the data-model level, the
sprite-cache properties-only update, export/relocation and campaign-switch
isolation (including that two independently loaded rooms never share
mask state), built-in/no-custom-block backward compatibility, and two
performance checks (large-particle-count empty-mask stepping, high-volume
`tierAt` lookups). No other Phase 2A-2F test file needed a behavioral
change; one pre-existing fixture in `customBlockProperties.test.ts` that
hardcoded a full property-object literal was extended with
`liquidInteraction: 'none'` to match the new required field, and all 1033
tests in the full suite pass (968 pre-Phase-2G + 65 new).

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (1033/1033
  passing), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase.
  `customBlocksPhase2G.test.ts`, the pixel-material test files
  (`pixelMaterials*.test.ts`), and the full custom-block test suite were
  additionally run directly and pass.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running
  game or editor session, for the same reason documented in every prior
  phase's section — this environment does not have an interactive
  browser/editor session available for this task. All verification here was
  done through the automated test suite exercising the real
  `PixelMaterialSystem.stepLiquidParticle`, `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`,
  `loadRoomHazards`/`loadRoomPixelMaterials`, and `applyHazards` code paths
  (not mocks) — but no actual frame was rendered, no seal/drain visual was
  observed by a human or automated UI driver, and no actual player-driven
  liquid placement or block destruction was triggered through real input.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually create
  seal and drain blocks (1×1 and 2×2, at least one non-solid) near placed
  water, confirm water is blocked/removed as expected, confirm the player
  still passes through non-solid/one-way liquid modifiers normally, break a
  fragile seal/drain block and confirm water behaves normally starting the
  very next visible frame, and confirm older campaigns (with no
  `liquidInteraction` field at all) are visually and behaviorally unchanged,
  prior to shipping.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **Pixel-material liquid only** — this phase does not touch authored
   water-zone buoyancy/submersion (`RoomZoneDef` `waterZones`,
   `playerWaterSubmersionRatio`/`playerBuoyancyDepthFactor`) at all; a
   custom block's seal/drain has zero effect on a player standing in an
   authored water zone.
2. **No partial/leaky seal** — `'seal'` is a hard boundary (0% transmission),
   with no dampen-style intermediate tier the way wind response has one.
3. **No drain rate or capacity control** — drain removes a liquid particle
   the instant it attempts entry; there is no throttling, no maximum
   drained-per-tick count, and no numeric rate exposed to campaign JSON
   (deliberately, to keep the property a bounded enum rather than an
   arbitrary physics number).
4. **Overlap rejection, not merging** — two liquid-modifier placements whose
   footprints overlap do not "combine" into some blended effect; the later
   one (in placement-array order) is simply not registered at all. This
   is intentional (see the Overlap Rejection section above) but means an
   author who genuinely wants two different tiers to coexist across a
   shared cell cannot express that.

## Phase 2H: Directional Wind-Vent Presets

### The New Property and Defaults

A fifth engine-owned property, `windEmission`, selects which face (if any) a
custom block continuously emits pixel-material wind from:

```ts
type CustomBlockWindEmissionPreset = 'none' | 'left' | 'right' | 'up' | 'down';
```

- **`'none'`** (the default) — emits no wind; a complete no-op.
- **`'left'` / `'right'` / `'up'` / `'down'`** — continuously emits wind from
  the corresponding outer face of the placement's footprint, every fixed
  step, for as long as the placement is active.

Deliberately named `windEmission`, distinct from the Phase 2F `windResponse`
property: `windResponse` controls how much of an EXTERNAL force is
transmitted THROUGH a block; `windEmission` makes the block itself a wind
SOURCE. The two are unrelated enums and may be set independently (see
Self-Occlusion below for the case where they interact).

Schema version stays **2**. Schema-v1 blocks and schema-v2 blocks saved
before Phase 2H both resolve `windEmission` to `'none'` via the same "field
absent → default, not an error" path used by every property since Phase 2C.
An unrecognized string value produces a structured `CustomBlockValidationError`
(`field: 'properties.windEmission'`) and falls back to `'none'`.

### Compatibility

Like `liquidInteraction` (Phase 2G), `windEmission` has **no collision
requirement** — `isEligibleForWindVent` checks only `windEmission !== 'none'`.
All fifteen `(collision × windEmission)` combinations are valid, and no new
`checkCustomBlockPropertyCompatibility` rule was added:

- A **non-solid** vent is a purely visible emitter the player walks through.
- A **one-way** vent emits while its one-way collision is untouched.
- A **solid** vent may simultaneously use `windResponse: 'block'` (making it
  its own windbreak from every OTHER source's perspective) while still
  emitting its own wind outward — see Self-Occlusion below.

### Engine-Owned Vent Constants and Tuning Rationale

All four directions share one fixed strength — no weak/standard/strong
tiers in this phase, deliberately (see Remaining Limitations). Constants
live in `src/sim/pixelMaterials/customBlockWindVents.ts`:

| Constant | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_FORCE` | 90 | Movement wind's own scale (`pixelMaterialMovementWind.ts`) ranges `MIN_FORCE=24` to `MAX_FORCE=130` (a grapple-zip player at full speed). 90 sits clearly above `MIN_FORCE` and above the sandstone erosion floor (`SANDSTONE_MIN_EROSION_WIND_SPEED=40`, post-material-response) — visibly strong and erosion-capable — while staying below `MAX_FORCE`, so a vent is never stronger than the most extreme player-generated gust. |
| `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_RANGE_PX` | 24 | Reused directly as `applyWindForce`'s `radiusPx`. Larger than movement wind's `MAX_RADIUS_PX` (11) since a vent is a persistent beam meant to visibly affect a stretch of material, not a brief local disturbance, but still bounded — cost stays `O(range²)`, not room-spanning. |
| `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_FALLOFF` | 1 | Full linear falloff to 0 at the edge of the range — matches every other wind source's default (movement wind, direct `applyWindForce` callers). |
| `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_HALF_FAN_DEG` (→ `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_COS_HALF_FAN_ANGLE`) | 40° | Narrow enough to read as clearly directional (not an omnidirectional gust with a favored side), wide enough to visibly affect a fan of cells directly in front of the face rather than a single-pixel ray. Precomputed once via `Math.cos` at module load — never recomputed per tick. |
| `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_SOURCE_OFFSET_PX` | 0.5 | Defensive margin placing the emission source just outside the footprint (see Self-Occlusion). |

Stability under continuous per-tick application is inherited for free from
the EXISTING `WIND_MOMENTUM_DAMPING` (0.85/step) already governing every
wind source: steady-state peak velocity from a constant 90 px/s impulse is
bounded at `90/(1-0.85) ≈ 600` px/s — the same order of magnitude Phase 2F's
docs already derived for continuous movement-wind/erosion application, so no
new damping or clamping logic was needed.

### Directional Geometry

"Forward range" and "lateral fan width" are expressed as **one cone**, not
two independent rectangle dimensions: the existing circular
`radiusPx`/falloff region (forward reach) intersected with an angular
half-plane test relative to the direction vector (lateral spread). This
keeps the geometry exactly cardinal-direction symmetric — rotating the
direction 90° at a time produces the identical cone shape, just rotated —
and needs no new region primitive.

For a placement with footprint `(xBlock, yBlock, wBlock, hBlock)` (world
units), the face center and outward unit vector per direction:

| Direction | Face center | Unit vector |
|---|---|---|
| `left`  | `(x, y + h/2)` | `(-1, 0)` |
| `right` | `(x + w, y + h/2)` | `(1, 0)` |
| `up`    | `(x + w/2, y)` | `(0, -1)` |
| `down`  | `(x + w/2, y + h)` | `(0, 1)` |

The emission source is the face center nudged `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_SOURCE_OFFSET_PX`
further outward along the unit vector. A 2×2 placement uses its COMPLETE
two-tile-wide/tall face (`w`/`h` already reflect the full footprint) and
emits exactly once — never once per occupied tile.

### Reusing the Wind Pathway: the `applyWindForce` Directional Gate

Rather than a second wind engine, `WindForceParams` gained three optional
fields — `dirX`, `dirY`, `cosHalfFanAngle` — and `applyWindForce` gained ONE
new conditional inside its existing per-cell loop:

```ts
if (dirX !== undefined && dirY !== undefined && dist > 0) {
  const cosAngle = (dx * dirX + dy * dirY) / dist; // dist already computed for falloff
  if (cosAngle < cosHalfFanAngle) continue;
}
```

This is Option 1 from the phase's own design menu ("extend the existing
params with an optional deterministic directional gate") — the smallest
possible change: no new function, no duplicated transmission/material-
response/dedup/wake logic, and `dist` is the SAME value already computed for
the falloff calculation (no extra `sqrt`). Every existing caller (movement
wind, direct test calls, the Phase 2F/2G test suites) omits `dirX`/`dirY`,
so the gate is a single `undefined` check for them — behaviorally identical
to pre-Phase-2H `applyWindForce`, verified directly by a regression test
comparing a call with and without an irrelevant `cosHalfFanAngle` when
`dirX`/`dirY` are omitted.

`customBlockWindVents.ts`'s `applyCustomBlockWindVents(world)` is the sole
production caller that sets these fields — mirroring
`pixelMaterialMovementWind.ts`'s role exactly, a caller that decides WHEN,
WHERE, and in which DIRECTION to invoke the unchanged primitive. It reuses,
untouched: `CustomBlockWindMask`/`resolveCustomBlockWindTransmission`
(Phase 2F transmission), `getMaterialWindResponse` (per-material response),
and `applyWindForce`'s existing particle dedup (`windAffectedScratch`),
momentum accumulation/damping, and wake behavior.

### Self-Occlusion

A block with `windResponse: 'block'` AND `windEmission: 'right'` still
emits rightward — solved geometrically, not by excluding mask cells.
`CustomBlockWindMask.markRect` marks a placement's OWN footprint as the
half-open range `[xBlock, xBlock+wBlock) × [yBlock, yBlock+hBlock)`. The
emission source sits at the face boundary plus a small outward offset —
strictly outside that half-open range — and the emission direction points
strictly away from the footprint. The Bresenham ray `traceMaxWindTransmissionTier`
walks from source to any forward target can therefore never re-enter the
block's own mask region: self-occlusion is structurally impossible, with
zero ownership/exclusion bookkeeping. An independent block placed further
along the emission path is NOT excluded by anything here and still occludes
normally — verified by two separate tests (self-windbreak-still-emits vs.
adjacent-independent-windbreak-still-blocks).

### Runtime Vent Storage

Mirroring `RoomWindTransmissionBlockDef`/`RoomLiquidInteractionBlockDef`,
`RoomCustomBlockWindVentDef` registers **one entry per logical placement**
(never per cell) into `RoomDef.windVentBlocks`, built by
`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` BEFORE the `!behavior.generateWall` early-continue
(no collision requirement, exactly like liquid interaction). No
overlap-rejection is needed here, unlike the liquid mask: each vent is an
independent point-source registration, not a shared single-byte-per-cell
mask, so overlapping vent footprints simply both emit independently with no
ambiguity.

`WorldState` gained bounded typed-array storage
(`MAX_CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENTS = 32`, matching the existing
`MAX_BREAKABLE_BLOCKS`/`MAX_CONTACT_DAMAGE_BLOCKS` scale):
`windVentCount`, `windVentXWorld/YWorld/WWorld/HWorld` (Float32Array
footprint), `windVentDirection` (Uint8Array, packed 0-3 via
`windEmissionDirectionToIndex`), and `windVentActiveFlag` (Uint8Array).
`loadRoomHazards` (gameRoomHazards.ts) populates these once at room-load
time from `RoomDef.windVentBlocks` — no JSON string is ever read during the
fixed-step simulation loop; the loop only ever touches pre-resolved typed
arrays.

### Fragile Vent Deactivation

An explicit runtime OWNERSHIP LINK, not a scan: `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`
assigns each registered vent its position in `windVentBlocks` as a
room-local index, and threads that SAME index onto every one of the
placement's breakable-block cells as `RoomBreakableBlockDef.windVentIndex`
(optional, mirroring `windResponse`/`liquidInteraction`'s per-cell
threading). `gameRoomHazards.ts` copies this into
`WorldState.breakableBlockWindVentIndex` (`Int16Array`, `-1` default).
`destroyBreakableBlockCell` (sim/hazards.ts) reads this index and sets
`windVentActiveFlag[index] = 0` — idempotent (setting an already-0 flag to 0
is a no-op), and because all four cells of a grouped 2×2 fragile vent share
the SAME index, contacting/destroying any of them deactivates the one
shared logical vent exactly once, never four times. Adjacent placements
have distinct indices and stay fully independent. An indestructible vent
never enters the breakable pathway at all, so nothing can ever deactivate
it. Room reload calls `loadRoomHazards`/`loadRoomPixelMaterials` fresh,
which resets `windVentActiveFlag` to `1` for every registered vent — the
same respawn semantics `isBreakableBlockActiveFlag` already has.

This runs inside `applyHazards`, called AFTER `applyCustomBlockWindVents`
in the tick pipeline (see Fixed-Step Integration below) — so a vent that
breaks this tick still emitted its impulse this tick, and stops starting
the NEXT tick. Same one-tick lag already accepted for the Phase 2F/2G
mask clears.

### Fixed-Step Integration

`applyCustomBlockWindVents(world)` is called in `tick.ts` immediately after
`applyMovementWindToPixelMaterials(world)` — the same fixed-step wind phase,
before `tickPixelMaterials(world)` — so vent-driven disturbance and
sand/water/sandstone settling happen in the same visual frame, exactly like
movement wind. Deterministic: ascending vent-index iteration order, no
`Math.random()`, no wall-clock timers, no per-tick string construction (the
vent caller does not pass a `sourceId` at all — that field is otherwise
unused by `applyWindForce`, so constructing one per vent per tick would be
pure waste). `windVentCount === 0` returns before touching anything else —
the required fast path.

### Interaction with Pixel Materials

- **Sand** receives the vent impulse through its existing `getMaterialWindResponse`
  multiplier and accumulates/damps momentum via the unchanged existing
  pathway.
- **Water** retains its existing higher response multiplier (verified: water
  ends up with strictly more momentum than sand from the identical vent).
- **Sandstone** accumulates erosion through the EXISTING erosion pathway
  (`erosionDamage += windSpeed × SANDSTONE_EROSION_RATE`) — no new rate or
  threshold; impact fracture (`applyPlayerImpactFracture`) is completely
  unaffected by vents, verified directly.
- **2×2 particles** receive at most ONE impulse per vent per fixed step —
  `applyWindForce`'s existing `windAffectedScratch` dedup (unchanged from
  Phase 3) already guarantees this; the vent caller does nothing special.

### Interaction with Other Custom-Block Properties

`windEmission` is fully independent of collision, friction, breakability,
material response, contact damage, break resistance, liquid interaction,
and wind response — verified directly: a fragile, reinforced,
high-contact-damage, metal, windbreak, drain, right-facing vent exercises
every one of those systems on its own existing pathway, untouched by this
phase (contact damage still applies below the break threshold, the block
still doesn't break below its reinforced threshold, the drain mask still
registers, and the vent keeps emitting until the block actually breaks).

### Editor Integration

A "Wind emission" dropdown (None/Left/Right/Up/Down) was added to
`editorCustomBlockDialog.ts` following the exact `makePropertyRow` pattern
used for every prior preset — dirty-tracking, undo/redo, and Save/Discard/
Keep-Editing all participate automatically since it's part of the same
`properties` object. A note beneath the dropdown clarifies the distinction
from "Wind response" above it. The palette summary in `editorUI.ts` gains a
concise directional-arrow badge (`Vent ←`/`Vent →`/`Vent ↑`/`Vent ↓`, silent
for the `'none'` default). Rename/duplicate preserve the property
automatically (verified via `serializeCustomBlock`/`parseCustomBlockSource`
round trips), and `updateCustomBlockProperties` changing only
`windEmission` does not rebuild the cached sprite canvas (same object
identity before and after).

### Backward Compatibility

- Schema-v1 blocks and schema-v2 blocks saved before Phase 2H load exactly
  as before — `windEmission` resolves to `'none'`, zero runtime effect (no
  vent registered, no fixed-step behavior change).
- Rooms/campaigns with no custom blocks, or no vent-emitting blocks, build a
  `windVentCount === 0` world — `applyCustomBlockWindVents`'s fast path
  makes this byte-identical to pre-Phase-2H fixed-step behavior.
- Movement-generated wind, wind transmission, pixel-liquid seal/drain, sand/
  water/sandstone behavior, water-zone buoyancy, and every other
  Phase 2A-2G behavior are completely unaffected — verified directly by
  tests placing a vent alongside each of those systems and confirming no
  change, plus a direct regression test proving `applyWindForce` without
  `dirX`/`dirY` is unaffected by the new optional fields.
- A hand-authored `RoomBreakableBlockDef` with no `windVentIndex` field
  (pre-Phase-2H shape) resolves to index `-1` and is never treated as a
  vent-owning cell.

### Performance Considerations

- `applyCustomBlockWindVents` returns immediately when `windVentCount === 0`
  — the required fast path, verified with 1000 consecutive zero-vent calls
  completing well under the test's time budget.
- One iteration over active vents per fixed tick, ascending index order — no
  full-room scan, no scan of all custom-block placements.
- Every value read in the hot loop is a pre-resolved typed-array entry — no
  JSON parsing, no registry lookup, no string construction (including no
  `sourceId`) during simulation.
- `applyWindForce`'s directional gate adds exactly one extra numeric
  comparison per already-scanned candidate cell (reusing the existing `dist`
  value) — no new allocation, no recursion, no new scan bounds.
- `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_COS_HALF_FAN_ANGLE` is computed once via `Math.cos`
  at module load, never per tick or per vent.
- Deactivation (`windVentActiveFlag[index] = 0`) is an O(1) idempotent write.

### Tests (Phase 2H)

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPhase2H.test.ts` (62 tests) exercises the
real pipeline end to end: schema-v1/v2 defaults, all five presets
round-tripping, unknown-value fallback with a structured diagnostic, numeric
packing round trip, the (deliberate lack of a) collision-compatibility rule
for `windEmission`, real room-builder wiring (one `windVentBlocks` entry per
placement, none for `'none'`, non-solid placements still register,
`loadRoomHazards`/`loadRoomPixelMaterials` populating `world.windVentCount`),
direct directional geometry for all four directions (on-axis effect,
off-axis/behind exclusion, out-of-range exclusion, rotational-symmetry
equivalence across all four directions), pixel-material interaction (sand's
material response including falloff-aware exact-value assertions, water's
higher response, sandstone erosion accumulation, impact-fracture
non-interference, 2×2 single-impulse dedup), wind-transmission interaction
(dampening attenuates, full block zeroes, an unrelated beside-the-path
blocker has no effect), self-occlusion (a self-windbreak vent still emits,
an independent adjacent windbreak still blocks it normally), multi-vent
additive combination, the zero-vent fast path, fragile-vent deactivation
through the real `applyHazards` destruction pathway (1×1 and grouped 2×2,
adjacent independence, indestructible permanence, room-reload respawn),
interaction preservation with liquid interaction/contact damage/break
resistance/material-response break feedback (including a
fragile-reinforced-damaging-metal-windbreak-drain-vent exercising every
system at once), editor dirty-tracking/undo-redo/rename/duplicate/
properties-only-update at the data-model level, export/relocation and
campaign-switch isolation, a direct regression proving `applyWindForce`
without `dirX`/`dirY` is unaffected by the Phase 2H extension, and
backward-compatibility spot checks. One pre-existing fixture in
`customBlockProperties.test.ts` that hardcoded a full property-object
literal was extended with `windEmission: 'none'` to match the new required
field. All 1095 tests in the full suite pass (1033 pre-Phase-2H + 62 new).

### Manual Validation (Honest Status)

- **Automated**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm test` (1095/1095
  passing), and `npm run build` were all actually run for this phase.
  `customBlocksPhase2H.test.ts`, `customBlocksPhase2F.test.ts`,
  `customBlocksPhase2G.test.ts`, the pixel-material test files, and the full
  custom-block test suite were additionally run directly and pass.
- **Not performed**: no manual verification was done in an actual running
  game or editor session — this environment has no interactive
  browser/editor session available for this task. All verification here is
  through the automated test suite exercising the real
  `PixelMaterialSystem.applyWindForce`, `applyCustomBlockWindVents`,
  `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`, `loadRoomHazards`/`loadRoomPixelMaterials`, and
  `applyHazards` code paths (not mocks) — but no actual frame was rendered,
  no vent visual was observed by a human or automated UI driver, and no
  actual player-driven vent placement, break, or drain interaction was
  triggered through real input.
- Anyone relying on this phase for a real campaign should manually create
  left/right/up/down vents (1×1 and 2×2), place sand/water/sandstone in
  front of each, confirm material behind/beside stays unaffected, combine a
  vent with a dampening and a blocking wall, confirm a self-windbreak vent
  still emits outward, break fragile vents (weak and reinforced) and
  confirm emission stops, test a vent combined with a drain, and confirm
  older campaigns (with no `windEmission` field at all) are visually and
  behaviorally unchanged, prior to shipping.

### Remaining Limitations

1. **One fixed strength tier only** — no weak/standard/strong vent-strength
   presets in this phase, deliberately (see the phase brief's explicit
   scope limit); every active vent uses the same
   `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_FORCE`/`RANGE_PX`/`HALF_FAN_DEG`.
2. **No emission toward water-zone buoyancy** — a vent affects only
   pixel-material particles; it has zero effect on a player standing in an
   authored water zone or on `playerWaterSubmersionRatio`/
   `playerBuoyancyDepthFactor`.
3. **No pulsing, interval, or trigger-gated emission** — a vent with a
   non-`'none'` direction always emits every fixed step it's active; there
   is no on/off cycling or player-triggered activation.
4. **Cone-shaped fan, not a rectangular volume** — the lateral spread is a
   fixed-angle cone intersected with the circular range, not an
   independently-sized rectangle; a very wide, short-range vent or a very
   narrow, long-range vent (independently tunable width vs. range) is not
   expressible in this phase's single-cone geometry.

## Proposed Phase 2I: Multi-Tier Wind-Vent Strength, Water-Zone Liquid Interaction, or Engine-Defined Triggers (Not Implemented)

Recommendation: **multiple fixed wind-vent strength tiers** (e.g.
weak/standard/strong, analogous to Phase 2E's break-resistance tiers) are
the best next phase, ahead of a water-zone interaction phase or generic
trigger behavior.

- **Multi-tier wind-vent strength** is the smallest, most precedent-following
  extension of Phase 2H itself — it would add a second bounded enum
  (`windEmissionStrength: 'weak' | 'standard' | 'strong'`, mirroring
  `BreakResistancePreset`'s exact shape) mapped to a small centralized table
  of `CUSTOM_BLOCK_WIND_VENT_FORCE`/`RANGE_PX` multipliers, reusing
  `applyCustomBlockWindVents` and the directional-gate `applyWindForce`
  extension wholesale — no new sim architecture, no new mask, no new
  fixed-step caller. This is the lowest-risk remaining candidate with a
  shape Phase 2E already validated end-to-end.
- **A later water-zone interaction phase** (extending `'seal'`/`'drain'`, or
  a parallel property, to authored water zones and player buoyancy/
  submersion) remains a reasonable second choice, but carries the same
  architectural caveat flagged in Phase 2G's own Remaining Limitations:
  unlike the pixel-material liquid/wind systems (pure per-cell/per-particle
  simulation layers this custom-block system has repeatedly integrated into
  at one gate function), the water-zone system directly drives player
  movement physics (`playerWaterSubmersionRatio`/`playerBuoyancyDepthFactor`
  in `worldHazardState.ts`), so a "seal" preset there touches player-facing
  physics more directly than any phase so far. It should start with the same
  investigation-first approach used throughout this series (locate the
  exact buoyancy integration point, confirm it can be gated without
  touching the buoyancy math itself) before committing to a property shape.
- **Engine-defined trigger behavior** (a custom block that fires a room
  event — a dialogue trigger, a transition, a one-shot switch — on player
  contact) remains a materially different kind of phase: every phase so far
  (2C through 2H) has mapped a bounded preset onto an EXISTING deterministic
  subsystem, whereas triggers would need a new event-dispatch concept even
  if built from existing primitives (`RoomDialogueTriggerDef` already exists
  as a non-custom-block zone). This is likely more design work than a
  single bounded phase, and a poor fit for the "reuse an existing pathway"
  pattern that has kept every phase in this series low-risk.

Not implemented in this phase — no code changes were made toward it.

## Playtest-Lifecycle Fix: Confirm/Playtest No Longer Loses Custom Sprites

A bug report described placing multiple custom 2×2 blocks in the editor: the
collision footprint was correctly 2×2, but after pressing confirm/playtest
the artwork rendered as plain blackRock wall tiles instead of one unified
2×2 sprite. Two independent defects combined to cause this, plus two smaller
related defects were found and fixed in the same pass.

### Root Cause 1 (primary): `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` dropped `customBlockPlacements`

`editorRoomDataToRoomDef` (`src/editor/editorRoomBuilder.ts`) read
`data.customBlockPlacements` to build collision walls (and breakable/contact-
damage/wind/liquid entries) but never copied the placements themselves onto
the `RoomDef` object it returns. `renderCustomBlockSprites`
(`src/render/customBlockGameplayRenderer.ts`) early-returns when
`room.customBlockPlacements` is `undefined` — so for any room built via this
path (which is exactly what confirm/playtest does), custom sprites were
never drawn at all; only the baked blackRock collision walls were visible.
Rooms loaded from JSON (via `roomJsonDefToRoomDef`) were unaffected, since
that path already copied the field — which is why this only manifested on
the confirm/playtest transition, not on a normal campaign load.

**Fix:** `editorRoomDataToRoomDef` now also sets
`customBlockPlacements: [xBlock, yBlock, namespacedId, tileWidth, tileHeight][]`
on the returned `RoomDef`, sourced from the same `EditorCustomBlockPlacement`
data (which already carries `tileWidth`/`tileHeight` resolved from the
registry).

### Root Cause 2: `closeEditor()` cleared the runtime sprite cache

`closeEditor()` (`src/editor/editorController.ts`) unconditionally called
`clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()`. `closeEditor()` is invoked only from
`confirmEdits()` and `cancelEdits()` — both transitions back to gameplay of
the SAME active campaign (playtest, or resuming the room that was open
before entering the editor). It is never used to unload or switch
campaigns. Clearing the sprite cache on this boundary meant that even after
fixing Root Cause 1, any block created/edited during the just-closed editor
session (or any block at all, since the cache was wiped) would have no
cached sprite for gameplay to draw — `getOrFallbackSprite` would render the
missing-texture placeholder instead.

**Fix:** `closeEditor()` no longer calls `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()`.
`state.customBlockRegistry`/`state.customBlockUsage` (editor-session-only
bookkeeping, never read by gameplay) are still cleared there, since they are
fully rebuilt from the campaign's committed `customBlockDefs` the next time
`toggle()` opens the editor. Ownership of the sprite cache's
clear-and-repopulate lifecycle is now cleanly two boundaries only:
- **Entering the editor** (`toggle()` in `editorController.ts`): clears +
  re-registers from `campaignSession.campaign.customBlockDefs`.
- **Loading/switching a campaign for real gameplay** (`game.ts`): clears +
  re-registers from the packed campaign's `customBlockDefs`.

Neither confirm nor cancel is a campaign-teardown boundary, so neither
should clear the cache.

### Hardening: missing-definition fallback now preserves the authored footprint

Previously `RoomDef.customBlockPlacements` had no footprint field at all, so
`renderCustomBlockSprites` always called `getOrFallbackSprite(rawId, 1, 1)` —
a missing/unregistered 2×2 definition would silently render a 1×1
placeholder under a 2×2 collision wall. `RoomDef.customBlockPlacements`
(and the corresponding JSON schema types in `roomJsonSchema.ts`,
`roomSavedTypes.ts`) now accept an optional trailing
`[..., tileWidth, tileHeight]` pair. `renderCustomBlockSprites` reads it and
passes it through to `getOrFallbackSprite` so a missing 2×2 definition still
renders a conspicuous 2×2 checkerboard placeholder. Older placement tuples
with no trailing footprint (pre-existing room JSON, or any 3-element tuple)
default to 1×1 exactly as before — fully backward compatible.

### Creation-dialog defect: "+2×2" silently created a 2×1 block

`openCustomBlockDialog` (`src/editor/editorCustomBlockDialog.ts`) took a
single `defaultTileWidth` option; `tileWidth` read it but `tileHeight` was
hardcoded to `1` for any newly-created block, so clicking the palette's
"+2×2" button actually created a 2×1 block until the user manually clicked
a footprint button in the dialog. The option was renamed to
`defaultTileSize` (a single square seed size, matching what the two
existing "+1×1"/"+2×2" buttons actually pass — `onCreateCustomBlock(tileWidth:
1 | 2)` never passes an asymmetric footprint) and now seeds BOTH
`tileWidth` and `tileHeight`. Editing an existing definition is unaffected —
`existingDef.tileWidth`/`tileHeight` still take priority over the seed.

The footprint-initialization logic was extracted into a small pure function,
`resolveInitialCustomBlockFootprint(existingDef, defaultTileSize)`, so it
can be unit-tested without a DOM (the dialog itself builds a modal and is
impractical to exercise in the Node test environment used by this repo's
test suite).

### Tests

New file `src/tests/customBlocksPlaytestLifecycle.test.ts` (13 tests):
1. A registered 2×2 block renders with a 2×2 destination rectangle.
2. `editorRoomDataToRoomDef`'s output `RoomDef` carries `customBlockPlacements`.
3. The exact confirm/playtest sequence (build RoomDef, render — no
   intervening cache clear) still finds and draws the 2×2 sprite.
4. `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` (simulating a real campaign switch) still
   empties the cache; a subsequently-missing id gets a fresh fallback, not
   stale data.
5. A 2×2 placement with no registered definition falls back to a 2×2 (not
   1×1) placeholder; a legacy 3-element tuple (no footprint recorded) still
   defaults to 1×1.
6. `resolveInitialCustomBlockFootprint` seeds both width and height to 2 for
   a "+2×2" request, both to 1 for "+1×1", and preserves an existing def's
   own (possibly asymmetric) footprint when editing.
7. Existing 1×1 rendering behavior is unchanged.
8. Multiple placements of the same 2×2 definition share one cached sprite
   object.
9. A broken fragile 2×2 placement (anchor cell inactive) still draws
   nothing, now that placements are preserved on the built `RoomDef`.
10. The `editorRoomDataToJson` → `roomJsonDefToRoomDef` round trip preserves
    `tileWidth`/`tileHeight` through serialization and reload.

### Known Gap Found But Not Fixed In This Pass

`game.ts`'s `loadFolderCampaign` branch (used for folder-based campaigns)
never calls `clearCustomBlockSpriteCache()` / `registerCustomBlockSprite()`
at all when loading straight into gameplay — only the packed-campaign load
path does. This predates this fix and is a separate, narrower gap (folder
campaigns loaded directly into gameplay, bypassing the editor) than the
confirm/playtest bug this pass addresses; it was not in scope here and was
flagged separately rather than folded into this change.
