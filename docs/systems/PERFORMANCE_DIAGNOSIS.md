# StickBlade — Rendering Performance Diagnosis

_Originally written for the room-transition performance improvement pass (BUILD 259). Updated in BUILD 401+ to cover in-room gameplay freezes._

---

## Executive Summary

Two separate classes of freeze have been diagnosed and addressed:

1. **Room-transition freezes** (BUILD 259–270): blank tiles and stall on room entry because sprites loaded lazily and `loadRoom()` was synchronous.
2. **In-room gameplay freezes** (BUILD 395–401): frame spikes while the player moves because derived visual canvases (shaded sprites, procedural block cutouts) were baked on-demand during active gameplay using expensive `getImageData`/`putImageData` calls.

Both problems have been substantially fixed. The sections below describe each in detail.

---

## Part A — Room-Transition Freezes (BUILD 259)

### A.1 — Lazy sprite loading causes blank fallback tiles

**What happened:** When `loadRoom()` ran it created `HTMLImageElement` objects but network fetches had not completed. Every tile fell back to a solid-colour rectangle until images arrived (50 ms–5 s depending on cache state).

**Fix:** `roomAssetPreloader.ts` preloads sprites for the spawn room and adjacent rooms before gameplay starts. `decodeRoomThemeSprites()` additionally calls `HTMLImageElement.decode()` so images are GPU-rasterized before first draw. The loading overlay waits for `areRoomSpritesReady()` and `isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady()` before releasing the player.

### A.2 — `loadRoom()` synchronous stall

**What happened:** Wall merge, BFS ambient-light computation, particle spawn, and bake-canvas creation all ran in one synchronous RAF callback. On large rooms this could take 30–80 ms.

**Fix:** A fade-out / fade-in transition (~167 ms) hides the stall. The room load executes at maximum fade (fully black) so the player never sees the partially-constructed room.

### A.3 — Adjacent rooms not preloaded

**Fix:** `preloadAdjacentRoomAssets()` fires `loadImg()` for all block-theme sprites in directly-connected rooms after each `loadRoom()` call. `preloadNearbyRoomAssets(room, radius)` extends this to radius-2 and radius-3 rooms.

---

## Part B — In-Room Gameplay Freezes (BUILD 395–401)

### B.1 — Per-tile shaded canvas explosion

**What happened:** `getTheme1x1SpriteShaded()` and `getTheme2x2SpriteShaded()` in `folderBlockThemes.ts` keyed the shaded-canvas cache by exact world coordinates (`worldOriginXWorld | worldOriginYWorld`). In a large room this produced one unique `getImageData`/`putImageData` bake per tile position — potentially thousands — all triggered lazily as the camera moved during gameplay.

**Fix (BUILD 395):** `SHADED_VARIANT_BUCKETS = 16`. Cache keys now use `variantBucket = hashTilePosition(col, row, seed) % 16` instead of exact world coordinates. Cache size is now bounded to `sprite_variants × mask_variants × 16` regardless of room size.

**Fix (BUILD 401 — gameplay-safe fallback):** When `isBakeForbiddenInGameplay()` is true, shaded-sprite functions now return a cheap **unshaded canvas** (plain `drawImage`, no `getImageData`/`putImageData`) rather than `null`. The unshaded canvas is permanently cached in `_unshadedCache8x8` / `_unshadedCache16x16`. Returning a non-null stable canvas means `hadFallbacksFlag = false` on the chunk, preventing repeated rebuild loops during gameplay. Shaded variants are baked only during loading/prewarm phases.

### B.2 — Same pattern in `proceduralBlockSprite.ts`

**Fix (BUILD 395):** `PROC_VARIANT_BUCKETS = 16`; all internal callers pass `col, row`.

**Fix (BUILD 401):** `getProceduralSprite()` now returns an unshaded fallback canvas (template compositing without edge shading) when bake is forbidden, stored in `_unshadedSpriteCache`.

**Additional fix (BUILD 401):** Unified private `_imgCache` / `_loadImg` / `_isReady` with the shared `imageCache.ts` (`loadImg` / `isSpriteReady`). No duplicate `HTMLImageElement` objects for procedural base/template images.

### B.3 — Baking allowed during active gameplay

**What happened:** Even with bounded caches, new shaded-sprite bakes could still occur during active gameplay whenever a variant bucket was first touched. On room entry, camera movement across new chunks would trigger `applyOrganicEdgeShading()` spikes in active gameplay frames.

**Fix (BUILD 401):** `perfFreezeProfiler.ts` exports a production-safe `setBakeForbiddenInGameplay(v)` / `isBakeForbiddenInGameplay()` flag (no DEV guard — works in production builds). `gameScreen.ts` sets it:

- `true` immediately after the gameplay path begins (before rendering).
- `false` at the end of the gameplay frame (after render, before `endFrame()`).
- `false` in every non-gameplay early-return path (editor, loading, paused, dead).

All expensive bake paths (`getTheme1x1SpriteShaded`, `getTheme2x2SpriteShaded`, `getProceduralSprite`) check `isBakeForbiddenInGameplay()` first and return a stable unshaded fallback if true.

### B.4 — Loading overlay released too early

**What happened:** The loading overlay's release condition was `!asyncLoadState.isActive && areRoomSpritesReady(currentRoom)`. This only checked folder-based block-sprite decode readiness. The background image could still be mid-decode.

**Fix (BUILD 401):** Condition now also requires `isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady(currentRoom)`. Added `isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady()` to `backgroundRenderer.ts` and a thin wrapper in `roomAssetPreloader.ts`.

### B.5 — Stale `_decodeInFlight` entries in `imageCache.ts`

**What happened:** When `img.complete === true` at the time `decodeImg()` was called, the promise resolved synchronously before `_decodeInFlight.set()` ran, leaving a stale in-flight entry that permanently blocked `isSpriteDecodeReady()`.

**Fix (BUILD 395):** Added `.finally()` with identity check after `_decodeInFlight.set()` to ensure cleanup even for synchronous resolution.

### B.6 — Prewarm queue stall

**What happened:** `roomRenderChunkWarmScheduler.ts` used `break` when one room was not ready, stalling the entire prewarm queue instead of skipping to the next room.

**Fix (BUILD 395):** Changed to `continue`; added `deferralCountThisSlice` guard (max 3) to prevent queue spinning.

### B.7 — Hardcoded block size in chunk memory estimate

**What happened:** `_evictStaleChunks()` in `chunkRenderCache.ts` computed chunk memory as `CHUNK_SIZE_BLOCKS * 8 * scalePx` (hardcoded `8` = assumed block size in pixels). This would silently underestimate when block sizes differ.

**Fix (BUILD 401):** Added `_lastBlockSizePx` field to `RoomChunkCache`. Updated at the start of `renderVisibleChunks()`. Eviction memory estimate now uses `CHUNK_SIZE_BLOCKS * this._lastBlockSizePx * scalePx`.

---

## Part C — Prewarm and Readiness Helpers Added (BUILD 401)

These APIs let the entry-viewport warm path intentionally bake derived canvases during loading:

- `prewarmFolderThemeShadedForChunk(themeId, colMin, rowMin, colMax, rowMax, seed, mask, blockSizePx, use2x2)` — iterates tiles, calls shaded-sprite functions under budget.
- `prewarmProceduralSpriteVariant(baseUrl, templateUrl, widthPx, heightPx, flipX, flipY, rotStep, mask, col, row, seed)` — calls `getProceduralSprite` for one variant.
- `isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady(worldNumber, backgroundId?)` in `backgroundRenderer.ts`.
- `isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady(room)` thin wrapper in `roomAssetPreloader.ts`.

---

## Part D — Entry Viewport Visual Warm (BUILD 402 / BUILD 404)

BUILD 401 made gameplay freeze-safe by returning stable unshaded fallback canvases when `isBakeForbiddenInGameplay()` is true. This eliminated all `getImageData`/`putImageData` spikes during active gameplay. The trade-off was that tiles visible immediately after room entry could appear briefly unshaded until their shaded variants were baked in a later frame.

BUILD 402 closes this gap by adding a bounded entry viewport warm pass.  BUILD 403 moved `tickEntryWarm()` into a dedicated early branch in the RAF loop.  BUILD 404 removes the remaining eager pre-tick from the instant transition callback.

### D.1 — Entry warm controller (`entryViewportWarm.ts`)

New module `src/screens/entryViewportWarm.ts` manages `EntryWarmState`, which tracks phase (`idle` | `warming` | `ready` | `timedOut`), frames elapsed, ms spent, and chunks warmed.

`startEntryWarm()` is called after every room load (initial startup, instant transition, and async transition generator completion). It computes the entry camera offset from the spawn block and stores the viewport parameters.

`tickEntryWarm()` is called **only** from the dedicated early branch in `gameScreen.ts`, which fires BEFORE `processPlayerCommands`, before sim ticks, before camera update, and before `FP.setFrameGameContext('gameplay')`. The frame context is set to `'entryWarm'` so freeze-profiler warnings distinguish entry-warm work from active-gameplay freezes. `setBakeForbiddenInGameplay(false)` is set explicitly in this branch so shaded sprites can be baked freely. When the warm completes or times out, subsequent frames proceed normally as gameplay frames with `setBakeForbiddenInGameplay(true)`.

**Instant cache-hit transitions** call `startEntryWarm()` then immediately show a lightweight textless overlay (`loadingOverlay.showEntryWarm()`) and return.  No chunk building occurs inside the transition callback.  The RAF loop's `entryWarm` early branch advances the warm on the very next frame; if no work is needed the warm completes in one frame and the overlay fades out in 80 ms.  This ensures the overlay is always visible before any warm work starts, preventing hidden hitches on the room-boundary frame.

### D.2 — Loading overlay gate

`tickLoadingOverlay()` in `gameScreen.ts` requires all of the following before releasing the overlay:

1. No async room load in progress (`!asyncLoadState.isActive`).
2. Source sprites are ready (`areRoomSpritesReady`).
3. Background image is decoded (`isRoomBackgroundDecodeReady`).
4. The entry warm pass completed or timed out (`isEntryWarmReadyOrTimedOut`).

The timeout (8 frames / 120 ms) guarantees this never produces a long loading screen.

A **room entry hold** guard after the `entryWarm` branch holds simulation and input while the overlay remains visible and sprites/background are not yet decoded.  This prevents gameplay advancing behind a still-visible overlay once the entry warm phase is done.

### D.3 — Guarantees

- **No warm work before overlay**: `tickEntryWarm()` is never called from `startTransitionLoad()`.  The overlay is always visible before the first warm tick runs.
- **No gameplay freezes**: the warm pass runs in an `'entryWarm'` frame context before command processing and sim ticks.  `setBakeForbiddenInGameplay(false)` is set explicitly, so all baking is outside the active-gameplay window.  The freeze profiler distinguishes `ctx:entryWarm` from `ctx:gameplay`.
- **Player fully protected**: `processPlayerCommands`, sim ticks, movement, and run-timer advancement are all skipped while `entryWarmState.phase === 'warming'` or while the room entry hold guard is active.  The loading overlay covers the viewport throughout.
- **Minimal unshaded fallback**: the loading overlay is held until the entry viewport's shaded chunks are ready or the safe timeout fires.
- **Bounded overlay delay**: worst-case extra hold is 120 ms (the timeout budget).
- **No-op when not needed**: `isEntryWarmReadyOrTimedOut` returns true immediately when phase is `idle`, `ready`, or `timedOut`, so rooms without folder-based themes release the overlay instantly (after the 80 ms entry warm cover fades).

---

## Already Well-Optimised Areas (Do Not Regress)

- **Chunked wall/background rendering** (`chunkRenderCache.ts`): walls and background blocks render through per-chunk offscreen canvases. Dirty chunks rebuild under a per-frame cap. Only viewport-visible chunks plus a safety margin are blitted.
- **Idle-time chunk prewarming** (`roomRenderChunkWarmScheduler.ts`): adjacent rooms' wall/background chunks are speculatively built during idle time and adopted on room entry.
- **Ambient-light BFS memoisation** (`buildAmbientDepths`): O(tiles) only on first use per configuration.
- **ImageCache deduplication** (`render/imageCache.ts`): `loadImg()` is a singleton cache.
- **Wall layout cache** (`blockWallLayoutCache.ts`): occupancy, neighbour masks, and 2×2 detection memoised per wall-snapshot signature.
- **Bounded variant caches**: `SHADED_VARIANT_BUCKETS = 16` in `folderBlockThemes.ts`, `PROC_VARIANT_BUCKETS = 16` in `proceduralBlockSprite.ts`.
- **Scene-light viewport culling** and **bloom empty-frame skipping**.
- **RenderProfiler** (F9 / pause-menu debug toggle): per-stage timing for BG/Walls/Entities/Particles/Dust/Bloom/Lighting/HUD.

## How to Use the Freeze Profiler

1. Open the pause menu → enable **Debug Overlay** → enable **Freeze Profiler**.
2. Move through rooms. Key fields:
   - `ctx:gameplay` — active-gameplay frame; freeze warnings are prefixed `⚠ GAMEPLAY`.
   - `ctx:entryWarm` — entry viewport warm frame; sim/input skipped, overlay active, baking allowed.
   - `ctx:loading` — async room load in progress.
   - `bake N×Xms` — shaded-sprite bake calls this frame. Should be **0** during active gameplay after BUILD 401.
   - `edge N×Xms` — organic edge-shading calls. Should be **0** during active gameplay.
   - `wChk N×Xms` — wall chunks rebuilt. Small spikes on first entry; tapers to 0.
   - `bChk N×Xms` — background chunks rebuilt.
3. If `bake` or `edge` spikes appear during `ctx:gameplay`, the `isBakeForbiddenInGameplay()` flag is not being set or the sprite function is not checking it.

## Remaining Known Issues / Future Work

1. **Entry warm lifecycle is complete (BUILD 404/405).** `tickEntryWarm()` is never called from inside `startTransitionLoad()`.  Instant transitions call `canSkipEntryWarm()` first — if the active chunk caches already cover the entry viewport (e.g. the room was prewarmed before the player arrived), the overlay is skipped entirely.  If warm work is needed, a lightweight textless overlay is shown and the RAF loop advances the warm in the dedicated `entryWarm` branch.  `ctx:entryWarm` is distinct from `ctx:gameplay` in the freeze profiler.
2. **Non-folder themes** (blackRock, brownRock, dirt, world sprites) are not checked by `areRoomSpritesReady()`. They begin loading at module init time and are typically ready within a few hundred ms.
3. **Base-chunk / lighting-overlay split** — `setActiveBlockLighting` invalidates whole wall chunks. Separating base tiles from lighting overlay would allow lighter lighting-only rebuilds.
4. **Global prewarm memory eviction** — `evictStalePrewarmedChunks(keepRoomIds)` is called at schedule start and after each idle slice that grows the cache past the quality-tier budget. True LRU ordering within the budget is not yet implemented — eviction currently prefers highest-radius/largest-memory candidates.
5. **Room render manifest** — Future: editor-exported precomputed render data (chunk occupancy, entry chunks, theme sprite URLs) to make room preloading deterministic.
